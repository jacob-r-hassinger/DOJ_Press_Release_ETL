0,1,INTERPOL Red Notice facilitates arrest of fugitive sex offender wanted in Texas,"<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenthdr"">
<p>WASHINGTON<strong> - </strong>INTERPOL Washington, the United States National Central Bureau (USNCB), announced the capture and return of Shilo Watts, 38, a United States citizen and resident of Atascosa County, Texas from Oman to the United States. Watts is wanted in Texas for charges of aggravated sexual assault of a minor, beginning when the minor was three years old and continuing over a prolonged period of time. In 2012, Watts fled the United States, resulting in the issuance of federal felony charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>In April, INTERPOL Washington expedited the publication of an INTERPOL Red Notice, or international wanted persons notice, for Watts based on the charges in Texas. The Red Notice was disseminated via INTERPOL's network to its 190 member countries around the world. Based on the efforts of investigators from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) International Investigations Branch, USMS Western District of Texas, and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security Service, Watts' was traced to Oman where the INTERPOL Red Notice provided police with the authority to arrest and lawfully return Watts to the United States on May 15. Watts is currently in the custody of U.S. authorities and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

<p>INTERPOL Washington Director Shawn Bray stated, “The capture of Shilo Watts is a great example of partnership between foreign, federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities, including the U.S. Marshals Service, Diplomatic Security Service, Office of International Affairs at the U.S. Department of Justice, and INTERPOL Washington. Through the close coordination of these authorities paired with the use of INTERPOL's international resources, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Diplomatic Security Service located, arrested and returned Watts to face justice in Texas in a matter of days.”</p>

1,2,Joint Law Enforcement Effort Leads to Issuance of First Ever Interpol Purple Notice from the United States,"<p>WASHINGTON <strong>-</strong> A joint investigation between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and Interpol Washington (U.S. National Central Bureau) has led to the publication of the first-ever Interpol Purple Notice issued by the United States for a vessel believed to be engaged in illegal fishing activities.</p>

<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>According to the Purple Notice, the fishing vessel named 'Stellar' was sighted twice in May 2014 operating on the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean by the USCG. It appears to change its name, national registration and other identifying characteristics in order to hide illegal activity. 'Stellar' is suspected of engaging in illicit fisheries transshipment activities near the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>

<p>'Stellar' was last known to have arrived in the port of Busan, Korea on June 3, 2014. The USCG provided information to the Korean authorities regarding the suspicious activities of 'Stellar' and recommended the vessel be inspected for potential violations.</p>

<p>“Illegal fisheries activity has a wide-ranging impact on the health and sustainability of the oceans fish stocks,” said Bruce Buckson, Director of NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement. “We're pleased to be working with Interpol, its member agencies, and the U.S. Coast Guard to combat this type of activity. We expect this international effort will help level the playing field for U.S. domestic fishers.”</p>

<p>“I commend NOAA, the USCG and Interpol Washington's Economic Crimes Division representatives for their extraordinary efforts, collaboration and partnership during this investigation which has resulted in the first Interpol Purple Notice issued by U.S. law enforcement authorities,” stated Interpol Washington Director Shawn A. Bray.</p>

<p>The United States wishes to make all 189 other Interpol member countries aware of the suspected illegal operations of the fishing vessel 'Stellar' (also known as 'Sungari'). By raising awareness of this vessel's operations, member countries will be able to investigate possible violations of their laws and take appropriate enforcement measures should the vessel attempt to operate illegally in their waters or ports, or under their national jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>Joint Law Enforcement Operation Leads to Return of Accused Argentine War Criminal Hiding in United States</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>WASHINGTON <strong>-</strong> An exhaustive investigation spearheaded by INTERPOL Washington and the U.S. Marshals Service International Investigations Branch ended with one of Argentina's most sought-after war criminals being located in Miami.</p>

<p>In December 2013, INTERPOL Buenos Aires requested assistance from U.S. law enforcement officials in establishing the whereabouts of Rodolfo Adolfo Gimenez. A former Argentine military officer, Gimenez, is accused of committing atrocities against civilians during Argentina's “dirty war” in the 1970s.</p>

<p><img alt=""Rodolfo Adolfo Gimenez"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20140319.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:275px"" />Knowing that an international arrest warrant would be forthcoming, Gimenez fled Argentina in October 2013, traveling through Chile and ultimately seeking safe haven in Florida. INTERPOL Washington and investigators from the U.S. Marshals Service subsequently determined Gimenez had taken refuge in a safe house situated well within the Spanish speaking community in Miami, where he believed that he could easily acclimatize and blend in.</p>

<p>On Friday, at the request of INTERPOL Washington, U.S. Marshals Service personnel from the Southern District of Florida and agents from the Miami office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations positively located and identified Gimenez and facilitated his removal from the United States back to Argentina. There, he was taken into custody by Argentine National Police representatives from INTERPOL Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>“This is an excellent example of U.S. law enforcement and the Argentina government working together to apprehend a wanted fugitive,” said Amos Rojas, U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Florida. “The Marshals Service is dedicated to pursuing all those who choose to flee rather than face justice.”</p>

<p>According to the INTERPOL Red Notice and warrants of arrest issued by Federal Courts in Argentina, Gimenez is specifically implicated “in the unlawful imprisonment of 22 year old Juan Marcos Herman, a political activist in student circles and a member of the anti-military Peronist Youth Movement. In July 1977, Herman was kidnapped at gunpoint by a group of military personnel.” He was subsequently taken to a clandestine detention center in Buenos Aires where he was “subjected to repeated mental and physical torture, and relentless interrogation.” Herman was never again seen alive, and his remains have never been recovered. If convicted as charged, Gimenez faces life in prison.</p>

<p>“I commend the work of all the law enforcement authorities involved in this investigation,” said INTERPOL Washington Director Shawn Bray. “This is a great example of U.S. law enforcement agencies and their international partners sharing information to locate and bring criminals to justice. No matter how far and hard this fugitive ran he could not escape the coordinated international effort to locate him.”</p>

<p>INTERPOL Washington credits the combined efforts of INTERPOL, INTERPOL Buenos Aires, the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement – Homeland Security Investigations and Enforcement Removal Operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Transportations Security Administration, the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of International Affairs.</p>

4,5,Bosnian National Extradited to Stand Trial for Murder and Torture,"<p>WASHINGTON<strong> - </strong>The United States has extradited Sulejman Mujagic, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a resident of Utica, New York, to stand trial in Bosnia for charges relating to the torture and murder of one prisoner of war and the torture of another during the armed conflict in Bosnia.</p>

<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p><img alt=""Sulejman Mujagic"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20130603a.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:350px"" />Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard S. Hartunian of the Northern District of New York, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton made the announcement.</p>

<p>“This extradition is the result of close cooperation between the U.S. and Bosnian authorities to bring alleged perpetrators of war crimes and torture in Bosnia to justice,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman.</p>

<p>“Through the coordinated efforts of many law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, Sulejman Mujagic will stand trial in a Bosnian court for the alleged murder of an unarmed soldier and the torture of a second soldier,” said United States Attorney Hartunian. “This case is a reflection of our steadfast commitment to support the rights of crime victims - wherever they are.”</p>

<p>“For the families who lost loved ones during the Bosnian war, justice has been a long time coming, but they can take some comfort in knowing that those responsible for this tragedy are now being held accountable for their crimes,” said ICE Director John Morton. “I applaud the outstanding work by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agents in upstate New York, ICE's Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, and our partners at the Department of Justice and Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities. Thanks to their efforts, Sulejman Mujagic will now face justice for his actions. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure our country does not serve as a safe haven for human rights violators and others who have committed heinous acts.”</p>

<p>Mujagic is being extradited to Bosnia to be tried for war crimes committed on or about March 6, 1995, during the armed conflict that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia has alleged that Mujagic, then a platoon commander in the Army of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, summarily tortured and executed a disarmed Bosnian Army soldier and tortured a second soldier after the two prisoners had been captured by Mujagic and his men.</p>

<p><img alt=""Sulejman Mujagic"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20130603b.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:350px"" />In response to the Bosnian government's request for extradition pursuant to the extradition treaty currently in force between the United States and Bosnia, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in U.S. federal district court on Nov. 27, 2012, and HSI special agents arrested Mujagic the next day in Utica, New York, for purposes of extradition.</p>

<p>On April 2, 2013, the federal district court in the Northern District of New York ruled that Mujagic was subject to extradition to Bosnia to stand trial for the murder and torture of the two unarmed victims. On May 31, 2013, Mujagic was delivered to Bosnian authorities and removed from the United States. The Office of the Cantonal Prosecutor of the Una-Sana Canton in Bihac is handling Mujagic's prosecution in Bosnia.</p>

<p>Mujagic entered the United States in July 1997 and obtained status as a lawful permanent resident in March 2001. Mujagic does not retain U.S. citizenship.</p>

<p>This case was investigated by HSI Buffalo, with assistance from the ICE Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center and INTERPOL Washington. The case was handled by Trial Attorneys Ivana Nizich and Jay Bauer of the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Carla Freedman of the Northern District of New York. The extradition was handled collaboratively with Criminal Division Trial Attorneys Ken Harris, Marcus Busch and Terry Schubert of the Office of International Affairs.</p>

<p>The case was a result of the close cooperation between the U.S. and Bosnian authorities, particularly the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Una-Sana Canton in Bihac, Bosnia.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Marshals, INTERPOL Nab Fugitive from Hungary in Florida</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>WASHINGTON <strong>-</strong> An intensive investigation spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals Service International Investigations Branch and the Fugitive Division of INTERPOL Washington, U.S. National Central Bureau, resulted in the arrest of Maria Luca Zavoczki, one of Hungary's most sought after criminals, in Miami Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p><img alt=""Maria Luca Zavoczki"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20140521.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:275px; margin:5px"" />In February 2014, Hungary issued an INTERPOL Red Notice indicating that Zavoczki had fled her native Hungary to avoid criminal prosecution related to narcotics distribution. Additionally, authorities there wanted Zavoczki for her role and participation in a European criminal enterprise that specialized in the manufacturing of bogus credit cards and committing bank fraud in Hungary, Austria, and Italy.</p>

<p>A former Hungarian competitive bodybuilder, Zavoczki travelled frequently to the United States for internationally-sanctioned bodybuilding competitions in Florida and California. Between 2003 and 2012, Zavoczki formulated and set in motion an elaborate scheme to change her identity and citizenship to avoid prosecution in Hungary and remain in the United States illegally.</p>

<p>At the request of Hungarian law enforcement, investigators from the Marshals Service and INTERPOL moved to locate Zavoczki as she attempted to evade arrest by moving through California, Colorado, Maryland, Florida and Mexico. She assumed multiple identities and aliases along the way.</p>

<p>The fugitive investigation gained significant momentum when a criminal investigator from the Department of State Diplomatic Security Service assigned to INTERPOL Washington determined that Zavoczki had more than likely obtained a U.S. passport by fraudulent means, while using a stolen identity. Zavoczki allegedly used the passport for international travel and as an official identity document.</p>

<p>Investigators sent information confirming Zavoczki's location to the Marshals Service office in the Southern District of Florida. Tuesday, members of the Marshals Service South Florida Warrant Squad, Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security Investigations, and the Boynton Beach, Florida Police Department took Zavoczki into custody without incident. She is being detained pending removal from the United States on immigration violations, and document and identity fraud. Zavoczki faces a 10-year prison term in Hungary.</p>

<p>“The capture of fugitive Maria Zavoczki, one of Hungary's most wanted, is an excellent example of what can be accomplished when law enforcement officials work together,” said Amos Rojas Jr., U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Florida.</p>

<p>“Criminals who steal identities and use false passports are a genuine threat to national security,” said Shawn A. Bray, Director of INTERPOL Washington. “Thanks to the outstanding cooperation of multiple law enforcement agencies, Maria Zavoczki poses a threat no more.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The efforts of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of International Affairs contributed to Zavoczki's arrest.</p>

7,8,ICE deports man wanted for kidnapping and murder in El Salvador,"<p> </p>

<p>WASHINGTON<strong> - </strong>A Salvadoran national, who was previously removed from the United States and who is wanted in his native country for homicide, aggravated kidnapping and robbery, was turned over to authorities in El Salvador Friday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).</p>

<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p><img alt=""Melvin Noe Lazo-Sanchez"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20130705.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:300px"" />Melvin Noe Lazo-Sanchez aka Melvin Noe Sanchez-Izaguirre, 34, a citizen of El Salvador and Honduras, was flown to El Salvador July 5 onboard a charter flight coordinated by ICE's Air Operations (IAO) Unit. Upon arrival, the suspect was turned over to officials from the El Salvadoran Civilian National Police (PNC).</p>

<p>“Mr. Lazo has been deported to El Salvador where he will now face a criminal court to answer to his charges, thanks to a dedicated group of deportation officers and ICE attorneys who serve to protect our communities here in Virginia,” said M. Yvonne Evans, field office director for ERO Washington. “Because of our far reaching impact, our officers maintain a global vision and are proud when justice is served, no matter where in the world.”</p>

<p>Lazo-Sanchez was arrested March 15 outside his residence in Manassas, Va., by officers of ERO Washington's fugitive operations team. An ERO officer assigned to INTERPOL Washington notified the team of an active Red Notice on Sanchez by law enforcement in San Salvador.</p>

<p>Sanchez illegally re-entered the United States after ICE removed him to Honduras in June 2012. He evaded extradition from Honduras to El Salvador when he was removed in 2012 because the last name he used on his Honduran identity differed from his El Salvadorian identity. Sanchez was ordered removed from the United States to Honduras or El Salvador by an immigration judge May 2.</p>

<p>The deportation of fugitive Melvin Lazo-Sanchez is another example of expanded bi-national cooperation to identify, arrest and repatriate Salvadoran criminal suspects who have fled to the United States to avoid prosecution. ICE officers are working closely with the PNC, the Salvadoran National INTERPOL Office and Salvadoran Immigration as part of this effort. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2013, the PNC executed more than 101 criminal arrest warrants with fugitives being returned to El Salvador aboard IAO removal flights. Many of those arrests involved homicide-related charges or other violent crimes.</p>

<p>Since Oct. 1, 2009, ERO has removed more than 640 foreign fugitives from the United States who were being sought in their native countries for serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder. ERO works with the Office of International Affairs for ICE's Homeland Security Investigations' (HSI) foreign consular offices in the United States and INTERPOL to identify foreign fugitives illegally present in the country.</p>

<p>This removal was coordinated with HSI El Salvador, ICE's Office of Chief Counsel in Arlington, the Consulate of El Salvador and INTERPOL Washington.</p>

8,9,"ICE returns recovered, 'most wanted' stolen antiquities to India","<p>NEW YORK <strong>-</strong> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) returned three recovered sculptures, valued at more than $1.5 million, to the government of India Tuesday during a repatriation ceremony at the consulate in New York City. One of the objects - a 350-pound sandstone sculpture stolen from an Indian temple in 2009 - was listed as one of INTERPOL's top 10 most wanted stolen works of art.</p>

<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>HSI Executive Associate Director James A. Dinkins presented the artifacts to Consul General of India Dnyaneshwar M. Mulay, alongside INTERPOL Washington Director Shawn Bray.</p>

<p>“The excellent international cooperation between the United States and India led to the recovery and return of these priceless antiquities,” said Dinkins. “The pilfering of a nation's cultural patrimony cannot and will not be tolerated.”</p>

<p>“Prevention of illegal trade in antiquities has emerged as an important area of cooperation between India and the United States as can be seen from this recent recovery of stolen Indian antiquities,” said Mulay. “I deeply appreciate the excellent work done by ICE HSI in getting these three priceless Indian assets recovered. The successful investigations and repatriation of these cultural artifacts underscores the importance of growing institutional partnership, which is of great significance to both countries.”</p>

<p>“There is no better example of what can be accomplished through the collaboration between US and international law enforcement via INTERPOL than the astounding results of this investigation, which have led to today's repatriation of these artifacts to their rightful place with the people of India,” said Bray. “INTERPOL Washington is proud to have been able to assist ICE Homeland Security Investigations in obtaining the documentation and images necessary to help identify the objects as those stolen from India.”</p>

<p>Two of the three artifacts returned to India were reported in 2009 by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), who notified the Indian Consulate about two sandstone sculptures stolen from the Gadgach Temple in Atru, Rajasthan, India. The 350-pound “Vishnu and Lakshmi” sandstone sculpture dates back to the 11th or 12th century and was listed as No. 6 on INTERPOL's top 10 most wanted works of art. Also stolen from the temple and repatriated during the Jan. 14 ceremony was the 600-pound “Vishnu and Parvati” sandstone sculpture, dating to the same period.</p>

<p>The third artifact is a male deity black sandstone sculpture, depicting a Bodhisattva, a popular subject in Buddhist art, and is believed to date back to the 11th or early 12th century from either the Indian State of Bihar or Bengal.</p>

<p>The investigation that led to this repatriation began April 13, 2010, when HSI New York special agents received information that the Indian sandstone sculptures recently looted from India were being offered for sale in the United States. HSI special agents discovered that the “Vishnu and Lakshmi” was transported from India to Hong Kong. From there, it was sold to a dealer in Thailand, and then resold to a buyer in London. The London buyer shipped the sculpture to New York City for an exhibition in March 2010. On April 15, 2010, HSI special agents recovered the piece while it was being shipped back to London.</p>

<p>On July 12, 2010, as a direct result of the “Vishnu and Lakshmi” seizure, a sister piece, the “Vishnu and Parvati,” was seized. It was transported to Hong Kong, sold to a buyer in New York and then sold and shipped to a buyer in Basel, Switzerland.</p>

<p>On July 7, 2011, the Indian black stone Bodhisattva figure was discovered being smuggled into the United States at Newark Airport by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. HSI special agents seized it after discovering that its accompanying paperwork declared Great Britain as a false country of origin. In addition, the item was grossly undervalued.</p>

<p>The New York County District Attorney's Office assisted in this investigation.</p>

<p>The last ICE cultural property repatriation to India was in 2006 when ICE agents in NY returned a ninth century stone idol that had been stolen from a temple in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh in 2000.</p>

<p>HSI plays a leading role in criminal investigations that involve the illegal importation and distribution of cultural property, including the illicit trafficking of cultural property, especially objects that have been reported lost or stolen. The HSI Office of International Affairs, through its 67 attaché offices in 48 countries, works closely with foreign governments to conduct joint investigations, when possible.</p>

<p>HSI specially trained investigators, assigned to both domestic and international offices, partner with governments, agencies and experts to protect cultural antiquities. They also provide cultural property investigative training to law enforcement partners for crimes involving stolen property and art, and how to best enforce the law to recover these items when they emerge in the marketplace.</p>

<p>Since 2007, more than 7,150 artifacts have been returned to 26 countries, including paintings from France, Germany, Poland and Austria, 15th to 18th century manuscripts from Italy and Peru, as well as cultural artifacts from China, Cambodia and Iraq.</p>

<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>INTERPOL's Stolen/Lost Travel Document database (SLTD) is a searchable repository of information on passports, visas, and identity documents that have been reported stolen or lost, helping prevent the illicit international travel of criminals and terrorists. Currently containing over 40 million records, SLTD is available to police and border security authorities in 190 INTERPOL member countries through their respective National Central Bureaus (NCBs). INTERPOL's General Secretariat administers the database, which became operational in July 2002.</p>

<p>Designed as an investigative tool for law enforcement and border protection entities, SLTD allows authorized users to query specific passport numbers. The database returns information on suspect documents that includes the issuing country, document type, document number, date of theft/loss, and certain information related to the circumstances of the theft or loss.</p>

<p>A country's passport issuing authority, through its corresponding NCB, is the only entity authorized to enter and modify records in SLTD pertaining to the loss or theft of its national travel documents. The United States is one of the largest contributors to SLTD, with over 3 million records currently on file and updates occurring on a daily basis.</p>

<p>INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, manages U.S. participation in the SLTD program. Its related responsibilities include ensuring the timely and accurate entry of stolen/lost U.S. passport data into SLTD upon receipt from the U.S. Department of State, establishing and maintaining SLTD query access by U.S. law enforcement and border inspection authorities, and performing verification and resolution in cases involving foreign passports recorded in SLTD presented to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at all U.S. ports of entry. INTERPOL Washington also coordinates with its foreign counterparts to resolve any cases involving lost, stolen, and fraudulent U.S. passports presented at foreign border control points.</p>

<p>In May 2007, Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State formally recognized the importance of SLTD as a screening tool for all travelers seeking to enter the United States. International organizations such as the G8, the European Union, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the United Nations Security Council have also endorsed the program. Presently all countries participating in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program report their stolen/lost passport data to INTERPOL for entry into SLTD, as set forth in the Implementing Recommendations for the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-53.</p>

<p>The United States currently screens the passports of all persons entering the country against SLTD. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State queries all U.S. visa applicants' passports against the database. In 2013, U.S. authorities conducted over 238 million SLTD queries, the majority of which came from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p><strong>INTERPOL and INTERPOL Washington request public assistance to track<br />
international fugitives across Americas</strong></p>

</div>

<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>LYON, France<strong> - </strong>INTERPOL is calling for the public's assistance in helping to track down international fugitives linked to organized crime networks and wanted for offenses including murder and drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Operation Infra (International Fugitive Round Up and Arrest) Americas was launched in Costa Rica on 18 November, involving 46 countries and territories and targeting 266 fugitives. Members of the public are now being asked to provide information to help locate 15 individuals, including Rafael Caro-Quintero the former leader of the Guadalajara Cartel in Mexico.</p>

<p>The fugitives are believed to be hiding out in Central America, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela or the Caribbean. They are all cases where no new leads were generated during the initial phase of Infra Americas or where there is no current intelligence on the potential location of these individuals.</p>

<p>“Any piece of information, no matter how small or apparently insignificant could be the missing piece in the puzzle which will help locate these dangerous criminals,” said Ervin Prenci, criminal intelligence officer with INTERPOL's Fugitive Investigative Unit.</p>

12,13,INTERPOL Washington Supports ICE Case on Serbian Fugitive,"<p> </p>

<div class=""presscontenthdr-container"">
<div class=""presscontenttext"">
<p>WASHINGTON<strong> - </strong>A Serbian man wanted for being the alleged getaway driver in a murder and attempted murder investigation was deported from the United States Monday. He was escorted to Belgrade, Serbia, after leaving Washington Dulles Airport, by officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), Washington Field Office.</p>

<p><img alt=""Milos Mihajlovic"" src=""/interpol-washington/news/images/news20130618.jpg"" style=""float:right; height:300px; margin:5px"" />Milos Mihajlovic, 29, a native of Serbia, entered the United States in May 2008, as a nonimmigrant visitor. On June 20, 2011, INTERPOL issued a red notice for Mihajlovic for attempted aggravated murder and unlawful possession of arms and explosives due to his involvement in an April 2008 shooting which left one person dead and two others injured in Nis, Serbia. Four days later, following an encounter in northern Virginia with a Fairfax Police Department officer, he was turned over to ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Washington.</p>

<p>Mihajlovic was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 2011. He appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, who remanded the case back to the judge for additional evidence and testimony. The judge again ordered him removed March 4.</p>

<p>“Individuals like Mihajlovic, who come to the United States to find safe haven from crimes they committed in their native country, are not welcome here and will be removed,” said M. Yvonne Evans, field office director for ERO Washington.</p>

<p>This investigation and removal was coordinated with HSI Attaché Vienna, HSI Attaché Paris, the Regional Security Office Belgrade, INTERPOL Washington and INTERPOL Belgrade.</p>

<p>Since Oct. 1, 2009, ERO has removed more than 646 foreign fugitives from the United States who were being sought in their native countries for serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder. ERO works with HSI's Office of International Affairs, foreign consular offices in the United States, and INTERPOL to identify foreign fugitives illegally present in the country.</p>

14,15,Assistant Attorney General John Carlin Delivers Remarks at the Brookings Institute's Emerging National Security Threats Forum,"<p>WASHINGTON - Thanks for that kind introduction.   I’m grateful to be here at Brookings today discussing emerging national security threats.</p>

<div>
<p>On Monday, the Department of Justice announced charges against five members of the Chinese military for computer hacking, economic espionage, and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals, and solar products industries.<br /><br />
Today, I’ll focus on this growing threat: state-sponsored cyber intrusions targeting, for profit, sensitive and proprietary information of U.S. companies.<br /><br />
These charges against uniformed members of the Chinese military were the first of their kind.   Some said they could not be brought.<br /><br />
At the Department, we follow the facts and evidence where they lead.   Sometimes, the facts and evidence lead us to a lone hacker in a basement in the U.S., or an organized crime syndicate in Russia.<br /><br />
And sometimes, they lead us to a uniformed member of the Chinese military.   But, no matter where they lead, there can be no free passes.<br /><br />
We should not stand idly by, tacitly giving permission to anyone to steal from us.   We will hold accountable those who steal – no matter who they are, where they are, or whether they steal in person or through the Internet.   Because cybercrime has real victims.<br /><br />
While cases like the one brought in Pittsburgh are extremely challenging, this week we proved that they are possible.   The criminal justice system must be a critical component of our nation’s cybersecurity strategy.   As long as criminals continue stealing from American businesses, we will continue pursuing those criminals.<br /><br />
The charges announced on Monday were groundbreaking.   They represent a significant step forward in our cyber approach.<br /><br />
And they were many years in the making.    </p>

<p><u><strong>The National Security Division</strong></u><br /><br />
Within the Justice Department, the National Security Division – or NSD – focuses on cyber threats to the national security – those posed by terrorists and nation states.<br /><br />
Our approach to these threats is deeply rooted in our Division’s history, and our success in the cyber arena builds upon a solid foundation.<br /><br />
NSD was created in response to the grave threat of terrorism.   After the devastating attacks of September 11, it became clear that the Justice Department needed to reorganize to tackle terrorism and national security threats more effectively.<br /><br />
We needed a single Division to integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community.<br /><br />
So, in 2006, Congress created the Department’s first new litigating division in almost half a century: NSD.<br /><br />
NSD works closely with partners throughout the government to ensure we leverage all available tools to combat the terrorism threat.   And we’ve proven, in that context, that the criminal justice system is a vital part of our nation’s counterterrorism strategy.<br /><br />
Just this week, Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted by a jury in New York on eleven counts.   He was involved in an attack in Yemen in December 1998 that resulted in the deaths of four hostages and provided material support to terrorists, including al Qaeda and the Taliban.<br /><br />
In March, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and other terrorism charges.   Abu Ghaith was the son-in-law of Usama bin Laden and a senior member of al Qaeda.   He was the face and voice of al Qaeda in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />
In both of these cases, it took more than a decade, but as a result of our integrated approach to combating terrorism, these men were brought to justice.   These cases are the two most recent in a long line of successful terrorism prosecutions.<br /><br />
Recently, we took the lessons we learned from counterterrorism and applied them to our work on national security cyber threats.   In the face of escalating threats, we recognized the need to reorganize.   To integrate.<br /><br />
When I was chief of staff for Director Bob Mueller, the FBI undertook a transformation to meet the growing cyber threat.   In 2011, NSD did the same.<br /><br />
In late fall of 2011, ten years after 9/11, we established a review group to evaluate NSD’s existing work on national security threats and chart out a plan for the future.   Six months later, that team issued recommendations that shaped what NSD’s national security cyber program looks like today.<br /><br />
Most significantly, in 2012, we created and trained the National Security Cyber Specialists’ Network to focus on combating cyber threats to the national security.   This Network – known as NSCS – includes prosecutors from every U.S. Attorney’s Office around the country, along with experts from the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and attorneys from across all parts of NSD.<br /><br />
Adopting the successful counterterrorism model, we now have prosecutors nationwide routinely meeting with the FBI to review intelligence and investigative files.<br /><br />
The creation of the NSCS Network was motivated by a desire to make a tangible impact on U.S. cybersecurity efforts through criminal investigation and prosecution.   By December 2012, we made public predictions that with the establishment of the NSCS – by empowering more than a hundred prosecutors in the field working with the FBI on these cases – one would be brought. <br /><br /><u><strong>The Pittsburgh Case</strong></u><br /><br />
And this week, we made good on that promise.   It is this new, integrated approach that made the Pittsburgh case possible.   As part of the creation of the NSCS, we brought prosecutors from around the country – Wisconsin, New York, and Georgia – to help NSD build this case.<br /><br />
We partnered with the Western District of Pennsylvania, where victims were repeatedly hit.   And we worked with offices across the FBI – from California, to Oregon, to Oklahoma, and back here in D.C.<br /><br />
Our team thought creatively.   They worked collaboratively.   They explored all available options for stopping this activity.<br /><br />
That’s how we were able to indict five members of the Third Department of the People’s Liberation Army, or “3PLA,” and its “Unit 61398.”   These men stand accused of cyber intrusions targeting a range of U.S. industries.<br /><br />
The indictment alleges, with particularity, specific actions on specific days by specific actors to use their computers to steal information from across our economy.<br /><br />
It alleges that while the men and women of our American businesses spent their business days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace, these members of Unit 61398 spent their business days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of Americans’ labor.<br /><br />
It alleges that they stole information particularly beneficial to Chinese companies, and took communications that would provide competitors with key insight into the strategy and vulnerabilities of the victims.</p>

<p><u><strong>Answering Critics</strong></u><br /><br />
Now, some question this law enforcement action.   Generally speaking, these questions fall into three categories:</p>

<ul><li><strong>First</strong> , whether there is a clear line between what these individuals have been accused of, and what the U.S. or other nations do;</li>
	<li><strong>Second, </strong>whether charges like these can truly impact cybersecurity, particularly when there may be significant challenges to arresting and ultimately trying these individuals in criminal court;</li>
	<li>And <strong>third, </strong>whether the government should instead focus on hardening defenses rather than pursuing charges.</li>
</ul><p><u><strong>Stealing Is Stealing</strong></u><br /><br />
As to the first question:   while some commentators may ask whether this is a new line to draw, in fact we are aware of no nation that publicly states that theft of information for commercial gain is acceptable.<br /><br />
Even in this case, China has not attempted to justify the allegations.   Instead, they deny them.<br /><br />
And this has been a consistent response.  A little over a year ago, the Chinese Government flatly denied reports that Unit 61398 was hacking U.S. companies.   A spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense said, “Chinese military forces have never supported any hacking activities.”<br /><br />
China also challenged the United States to present “hard evidence, evidence that could stand up in court,” that cyber attacks against American targets are connected to the Chinese military.   Well, we did.<br /><br />
The response?   Hours after Monday’s announcement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called the accusations “purely fictitious, extremely absurd.”<br /><br />
Now, we are confident that we have the evidence to back up these accusations in a court of law.   Read the indictment.   For the first time, we have exposed the real faces and names behind the keyboards in Shanghai used to steal from American businesses.<br /><br />
This is not conduct that responsible nations within the global economic community should tolerate.<br /><br />
In the United States, we believe that individuals and companies are entitled to the results of our creativity, including our property—and intellectual property.   And we believe their work should not simply be taken from them and given to others.<br /><br />
This is not a uniquely American value.   Individuals around the world believe that people shouldn’t take what others make.<br /><br />
Responsible nations do conduct intelligence activities.   And nations openly acknowledge that they have intelligence services.   Like others, our intelligence activities are focused on the national security needs of our country.<br /><br />
That is why the President, earlier this year, reaffirmed in PPD-28 that “[i]t is not an authorized foreign intelligence . . . purpose to collect such information to afford a competitive advantage to U.S. companies and U.S. business sectors commercially.”<br /><br />
U.S. foreign intelligence collection occurs under the framework of the rule of law, involving oversight by all three branches of Government.   As the Church Committee Report recognized back in 1976, “the Constitution provides for a system of checks and balances and interdependent power as between the Congress and the executive branch with respect to foreign intelligence activity.”<br /><br />
The very protections built into that legal framework subject that information to rigorous oversight, and prevent sharing it with private companies for their private gain.<br /><br />
But let’s be clear: those same protections do not exist in certain other countries that are targeting, every day, American trade secrets, sensitive business information, and intellectual property in order to steal specific information and pass it along to their domestic companies in order to give them a competitive edge.   To pretend otherwise is to promote a narrative of false equivalency.<br /><br />
Even though we know of no nation that stands up publicly to defend corporate theft for the profit of state-owned enterprises, in the shadows, some appear to encourage and support it.<br /><br />
In short, we allege the members of Unit 61398 committed theft, pure and simple.<br /><br />
So although this case is the first of a kind, it is also, in some respects, just business as usual.   As they have for decades, prosecutors in the field and at CCIPS use criminal investigation and prosecution to disrupt cyber crime.   CCIPS is one of our most important partners in the fight against cyber threats.<br /><br />
Law enforcement has long been used to combat cyber threats and, as recently as this week, has made a tremendous impact on our nation’s cybersecurity.<br /><br />
As you have likely seen, on Monday, the Department of Justice announced charges in connection with Blackshades malicious software.   These charges were part of the largest-ever global cyber law enforcement operation, involving more than 90 arrests and other law enforcement actions in 19 countries.<br /><br />
Likewise, in the national security arena, when criminal law enforcement is the most effective tool we have to disrupt a terrorist threat, we employ it no matter how far away or shielded from prosecution the defendants may seem today.<br /><br />
When criminal enterprises steal our intellectual property and personal information, or threaten our security, we investigate and prosecute them.<br /><br />
These are not the first charges that we have lodged against individuals who steal from Americans to benefit state-owned enterprises.<br /><br />
As just one example, in March, we successfully obtained a significant conviction for economic espionage.<br /><br />
Walter Liew, an electrical engineer, obtained one of DuPont’s secrets – a process, honed over many decades, for making a multi-purpose white pigment – and passed it to a large Chinese state-owned company.<br /><br />
What Liew stole was something Americans see and use daily.   Something that does not have a national security implication.   Something that simply brings a profit.<br /><br />
Liew stole the formula for the color white.   He was brought to justice in the U.S. criminal justice system.<br /><br />
Like Liew, we allege that the members of Unit 61398 stole to benefit Chinese state-owned enterprises.   The thefts are similar.   They both took place here.   The difference is that Unit 61398 operated remotely, from the previously safe spaces in Shanghai.<br /><br />
We will no longer permit safe havens.   Individuals cannot avoid the consequences of their actions simply by capitalizing on 21<sup>st</sup> century tools and operating from the comfort of their desks half a world away.  </p>

<p><u><strong>Meeting the Threat of Cyber Economic Espionage</strong></u><br /><br />
These crimes are the same as many crimes that we have investigated and prosecuted before.   Only the method or means is different.<br /><br />
But the threat we face is increasingly moving out of the physical world and into cyberspace, and thus, prosecutions of those who steal from us remotely must and will become the new normal.   We will continue to pursue this option, along with others available to us.<br /><br />
The threat of economic espionage is serious, and the threat of cyber economic espionage is mounting.   Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property.   That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia.<br /><br />
Losses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs.   They reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation.   As U.S. Attorney David Hickton said on Monday, “When these cyber-intrusions occur, production slows, plants close, workers get laid off and lose their homes.”<br /><br />
Such activity also undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy.<br /><br />
And our companies cannot face it alone.   Companies cannot depend solely on their antivirus software to defend against attackers linked to deep state military budgets.   It’s not a fair fight.<br /><br />
To defend against those empowered by a government, we need our government on our side.   We must support our entrepreneurs by using every tool we have, to prevent, deter, and disrupt this conduct in any way we can.<br /><br />
And likewise, we need you.   Just as the local police can’t control crime without victims calling in those crimes, our law enforcement officials, too, need cooperation from victims.   It’s our hope that the more cases we bring and the more perpetrators we bring to justice, the higher the level of cooperation we’re likely to receive.<br /><br />
We cannot let this conduct go undeterred.   Doing so would threaten our nation’s security.</p>

<p><strong><u>Deterring Cyber-Enabled Economic Espionage</u>   </strong><br /><br />
Cases like the Pittsburgh case will have a deterrent effect.<br /><br />
To those critics who raise questions about whether these charges will have any impact in light of the challenges associated with arresting and trying these individuals – the deterrent effect of charges can be significant.<br /><br />
General Keith Alexander, former NSA Director, explained that “the only way to deter cyber attack is to work to catch perpetrators and take strong and public action when we do.”<br /><br />
FBI Director Mueller called for figuring out who is targeting us and going after them, saying: “We must remember that behind every intrusion is a person responsible for that intrusion—a warm body behind the keyboard, whether he or she sits in Tehran or Tucson; Shanghai or Seattle; Bucharest or the Bronx.   Our ultimate goal must be to identify and deter the persons behind the keyboards.”   The government and private sector alike are increasing the call for prosecuting cyber theft of trade secrets.<br /><br />
We need to <em>prevent</em> attacks.   And deterrence helps.   Prosecutions can simultaneously punish those who have already committed bad acts and deter those who might otherwise commit bad acts in the future.   In other words, by going after these crimes, we can help to stop the next group of criminals.<br /><br />
It is, of course, possible that we will never obtain custody.   But even if these five defendants evade arrest, laying bare this criminal activity takes it out of the shadows.</p>

<p><u><strong>Law Enforcement: One Piece of the Puzzle</strong></u><br /><br />
Law enforcement investigations can also support other valuable tools.   Criminal charges can justify economic sanctions from our colleagues in the Treasury Department, sanctions that prevent criminals from engaging in financial transactions with U.S. entities and deny access to the U.S. financial system.<br /><br />
They can facilitate diplomacy by the State Department, as our nation’s diplomats lay out evidence of state-sponsored cyber theft to foreign government officials and force them to answer for those actions, or coordinate with other victimized countries.   Furthermore, the investigations themselves can lead other governments to take action, even when the United States doesn’t end up doing so.<br /><br />
So, we will continue to bring these kinds of cases.   However, it is not easy.   Prosecutions like this present unique challenges.<br /><br />
Cases can take years to investigate, and it can sometimes be tough to attribute the unlawful activity to particular individuals.<br /><br />
They involve difficult decisions regarding how to protect sensitive sources and methods.   And even after charging, it can be challenging to obtain custody of the defendants and bring them to justice.<br /><br />
But difficult does not mean impossible, and the status quo <em>simply will not do</em>.   As the Attorney General said earlier this week in announcing these charges, “enough is enough.”<br /><br />
We would not stand idly by as people hauled away our wealth in trucks.   Likewise, we cannot allow it to be sucked out through the Internet.<br /><br />
The indictment I’ve been discussing is an important first step.   But it must be just that – the first.   Prosecutions will not do it alone.<br /><br />
We need to build on this success and keep responding—with prosecutions where possible and with all of the other tools in our toolkit.<br /><br />
We need to keep at it, and we appreciate the bipartisan support we’ve received from Congress, including particularly supportive words from Senators King and Whitehouse as well as from the House Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees.<br /><br />
Many of these individuals provided resources and encouragement as we undertook transformation.   We must continue until our adversaries realize that the costs of stealing from our companies outweigh the benefits.</p>

<p><u><strong>Cyber Defense – Empowering victims</strong></u><br /><br />
So far, we talked primarily about criminal prosecution and other tools.   But we recognize that stopping attacks before they ever take place is the ultimate goal.   We will have succeeded when there are no more criminal charges to bring.<br /><br />
To that end, we also worked hard to improve cyber defenses, both in Government and with the private sector.<br /><br />
The FBI works closely with companies that have been the victims of hackers through, among other things, its InfraGard program.   That program, which has more than 25,000 active members, brings together individuals in law enforcement, government, the private sector, and academia to talk about how to protect our critical infrastructure.<br /><br />
Likewise, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and other departments and agencies routinely work closely with companies to protect critical infrastructure.<br /><br />
The Department heard from you and is taking steps to respond to the concerns of the private sector.   Just last month, we teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a policy statement making it clear that antitrust law is not and should not be a bar to legitimate cyber security information sharing.<br /><br />
And earlier this month, the Justice Department offered a white paper clarifying that the Stored Communications Act doesn’t ordinarily restrict network operators from sharing certain data with the Government to guard information.  This guidance will help the private sector collaborate more freely to protect itself.   All of this is just a start.   Going forward, we need legislation to facilitate greater information sharing between the private sector and the government.</p>

<p><u><strong>Educating the Public</strong></u><br /><br />
The charges announced earlier this week benefit not only victims but also the broader American people, and others worldwide.<br /><br />
Chief Justice Burger once noted that criminal prosecutions, as a general matter, have an “educative effect” on the public.<br /><br />
While we may appreciate, on a theoretical level, that hacking to steal corporate secrets poses a major national security threat, there’s no substitute for the educative effect that an indictment has.<br /><br />
Putting a face at the keyboard, and quantifying the damage done, may help to galvanize all of us to improve our cyber security.   It may also make us more vigilant to the economic, military, and geopolitical dangers associated with cyber space.   For example, it might lead companies and other entities to examine their connection logs a little bit more closely to see what activities those reveal, and from where.</p>

<p><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u><br /><br />
To wrap up, I want to applaud the dedicated investigators and prosecutors whose hard work produced this week’s important indictment.   It’s only a first step but it’s a big step, and it’s part of our growing effort to hold accountable those who steal American innovation.<br /><br />
At the same time, we must acknowledge that prosecution alone is, ultimately, just one tool in the broader toolset for addressing the cyber threat.   Prosecutions alone will not solve the problem.<br /><br />
Trust in government depends, in part, on our ability to defend, protect, and obtain justice for our citizens.   Indictments and prosecutions are one clear and powerful way in which we the people, governed by the rule of law, legitimize and prove our allegations.<br /><br />
And those actions have real consequences for the criminals they target, and deter those who might otherwise become criminals in the future.<br /><br />
We continue to protect Americans from being victimized through cyberspace, and we need your support.<br /><br />
Thank you for your attention.   I look forward to questions.</p>

<p>It shows that – while the men and women of our American businesses spent their business days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace – these members of unit 61398 spent their business days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of our labor.</p>

<p>And it shows that the business information these individuals stole, including trade secrets, would have been particularly beneficial to Chinese companies.</p>

<p>Let me give you some examples of allegations from the indictment:</p>

<p>Right about the time SolarWorld was rapidly losing its market share to Chinese competitors that were pricing exports well below costs, these hackers were stealing cost, pricing, and strategy information from SolarWorld’s computers.</p>

<p>And while Westinghouse was negotiating with a Chinese state-owned enterprise over the construction of nuclear power plants, the hackers stole trade secret designs for components of those plants. </p>

<p>To be clear, this conduct is criminal. </p>

<p>And it is not conduct that most responsible nations within the global economic community would tolerate.</p>

<p>At the Department of Justice, we have repeatedly pledged that we would do more to hold accountable those that engage in these actions. </p>

<p>Today, we begin to fulfill that pledge. </p>

<p>And we will continue using all of the tools at our disposal to pursue those who steal our intellectual property, no matter who they are or where they reside. </p>

<p>Now I’d like to turn it over to David Hickton, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, whose office has been a crucial partner in this investigation.  David?</p>

16,17,Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin Delivers Remarks at the American University Business Law Review 2014 Symposium,"<p>Thank you for that kind introduction – and for inviting me here today.  It’s a pleasure to be back at AU, and a privilege to join so many experts, essential partners, and good friends in advancing one of the most important conversations currently facing government and private sector leaders across the country. </p>

<p>At the Justice Department’s National Security Division, there is little we do that is more important than working on how the government can partner with private companies to protect our nation and its people better – from terrorism, from cyber attacks, and from a range of other malicious activities.</p>

<p>This past December, I attended a ceremony marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which claimed the lives of 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. 189 were Americans.  It was the deadliest act of terror against the United States prior to September 11th.</p>

<p>The families and friends of those who were lost came together that winter day at Arlington National Cemetery to recall the event that changed their lives forever.  They spoke movingly of loved ones who had been on board that plane, many of whom were American college students flying home for the holidays.</p>

<p>On December 21, 1988, instead of reuniting with their companions and loved ones, they heard news reports of a catastrophic explosion and wreckage strewn over miles of the Scottish countryside.  Shortly thereafter, they learned, as did the rest of the world, that terrorists were to blame.</p>

<p>There was a call for justice – to find the perpetrators and hold them responsible.  And there was also a call for new security measures designed to stop another attack from happening. </p>

<p>At the ceremony last winter, former Secretary of Labor Ann McLaughlin Korologos spoke of her experience leading the seven-member Presidential Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism that was formed a few months after the attack to investigate what went wrong.  Eighteen months after Lockerbie, that Commission issued a report calling for national attention to our aviation security system, and identifying a host of specific proposals intended to harden our nation’s airline security and keep all Americans safe – both at airports and in the skies.</p>

<p>Many of these measures did not become reality.  Interest faded, attention waned – and so did political and social will.  Twelve years later, the horror of 9/11 changed that.  It reinvigorated the focus on aviation security – and the 9/11 Commission called for many of the same security measures called for in the wake of Lockerbie.  This time, almost all of them were implemented.</p>

<p>Today, national leaders in both government and private industry must apply the lessons we learned from unspeakable tragedies like these, and from decades of effective counterterrorism policy, to business action in cyberspace.   It is imperative that we take action promptly, without waiting for a galvanizing tragedy.  We can work together to change norms now -- not in the wake of an immensely damaging terrorist cyber attack.  In doing so, we will have a much better chance of preventing such an attack from ever taking place. </p>

<p>I grew up in New York City, a place where you can experience the anonymity now enjoyed by so many on the Internet.  And when I was a kid, the NYPD sent an officer to our school who told us how to conduct ourselves on the streets of New York. </p>

<p>Our version of Officer Friendly told us to look both ways when we crossed the street.  Of course, he told us not to make eye contact with people on the street -- which was pretty standard advice back then. </p>

<p>As a kid, that seemed to make total sense.  Decades later, New York City is now one of the safest major cities on the planet.  And when we look back at that advice, it seems crazy that there was a consensus of blaming the victim for making eye contact.  These days, on the internet, we tell our kids to beware of chatting with individuals they don’t know, to avoid certain websites or apps. </p>

<p>When a person’s credit card gets stolen, or their credentials for accessing a social media site or their bank are hacked, we tell them, “You should have known better than to go to that website,” or, “You shouldn’t have used the same 18-character password more than once.” Together, hopefully, we can look back in a few short years and think that that those warnings and the victim-blaming is also strange and that we’ve come a long way with regards to cyber security.</p>

<p> One of the things that’s changed in New York over the years is its social norms – like making eye contact.  We need to shape social norms in the cyber area, too.  Just as it was in a chaotic urban environment, it’s tricky to cultivate trust in cyberspace.  There were streets in New York where the bad guys and the good guys passed each other shoulder to shoulder.  The same thing is true in cyberspace.  Legitimate businesses and innocent customers use the same Internet that hackers and terrorists use.</p>

<p>As my former boss at the FBI, Bob Mueller, explained, bad actors – specifically terrorists – are using cyberspace for at least three discrete aspects of terrorist activity: (1) to propagandize and recruit; (2) to plot and plan attacks in the physical world; and (3) to launch attacks in the virtual world itself.  It’s hard to cultivate trust online amidst such company and to restore a sense of security. <br />
But like change in New York, change in cyberspace will be a community effort.  When our Officer Friendly came to visit, he told us about Safe Havens – businesses that opened themselves up just a little bit, to be better members of the community, and to provide a place for people to go if they felt threatened.  Back then, there were little yellow Safe Haven signs on the doors of stores in New York, and he told us, “If you’re feeling uncomfortable or scared, or are being targeted, don’t be afraid to go into one of these stores and seek help.  Your safety should be your first priority.” </p>

<p>Just as those Safe Havens existed as trusted businesses when I was kid, the government and the corporate community can come together to create safe havens in cyberspace. </p>

<p>We need to work together to prevent terrorists from using networks – using the very websites and apps we use every day – to plot attacks in the physical world.  And we need to shore up our security so that devastating attacks cannot be launched in the virtual world.  These tasks are not easy, and they are ones we need to undertake with care, to strike a proper balance between security and liberty.</p>

<p>Some businesses, especially those in the communications sectors, may be hesitant to build new partnerships with government – or are drawing back from their current partnerships – because of the national discussion that has taken place over the last year. <br />
The President has committed to providing greater transparency about the government’s lawful use of data collection authorities.  However, as the President has noted, the nature of some unauthorized disclosures have shed more heat than light.  And that heat has come onto companies as well, often unfairly.  We take their concerns seriously, and we are dedicated to increasing transparency as well as protecting civil liberties.  That is why many layers of checks and balances are built into the systems – without question some of the best protections provided by any country in the world.  Our authorities are rigorously overseen by Congress, and often scrutinized by the courts and independent government watchdogs.  And they are aimed at ensuring the safety of the nation and our allies. </p>

<p>Of course, the private sector should not be punished for complying with the law.  We are concerned about this issue, and we are dedicated to working with companies to address misconceptions, correct misinformation, and help to rebuild the public’s confidence that our partnerships are conducted under the law.  We are working with industry to help them be more transparent about what kinds of information they are required to share with the government, and how very few of their customers are ever impacted by government actions. </p>

<p>Yesterday’s announcement by the President of a way forward on the handling of telephony metadata indicates just how committed the Government is to ensuring that the public’s concerns are addressed, without the Government sacrificing certain operational needs.  As you might have heard, the President announced a proposal that will, with the passage of appropriate legislation, allow the government to end bulk collection of telephony metadata records under Section 215, while ensuring that the government has access to the information it needs to meet its national security requirements.</p>

<p>Getting our legal policies right is one thing.  But make no mistake: It will lead to tragedy if the ultimate result of these disclosures is to cause businesses to shy away from working with the government to prevent terrorism.   The undeniable truth is that our collaboration, and the protections we have put in place together, make us safer from those who would attempt to do us harm – from terrorists to hostile nation-states seeking to capitalize on our vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>One example that comes to mind is the case of Khalid Aldawsari, a college student from Saudi Arabia who took chemistry classes at Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas.  When he began placing large and unusual orders for chemicals online, the chemical company reported the order to the FBI, as did the shipping company.  Ultimately, he was convicted in federal court and sentenced to life in prison for trying to use those chemicals to make a bomb, potentially to attack a former President.  And heading off that threat all began with two companies taking the right step of alerting the FBI to suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Whenever the public faces a threat, whether from terrorists, computer hackers, or pick-pockets on the Metro, people expect the government to protect them.  But the government can’t do it alone.  And that is particularly true in the context of cyber threats, given just how much of our nation’s most essential information is found online and, in particular, in the hands of private companies.</p>

<p>You know the threats we face.  You’ve seen them firsthand.  Although we often think of the government and our brave men and women serving abroad as a primary focus of terrorist attacks, we must keep in mind that the 9/11 attacks targeted this nation as a whole, and its impact was felt by all of us. </p>

<p>Since then, terrorism is now increasingly diverse and decentralized, from al Qaeda affiliates overseas to homegrown terrorists – such as the Boston Marathon bombers – who may live in the communities they intend to strike.  But the cyber threat is growing rapidly, and down the road, may rival or even surpass the threat we face today. </p>

<p>Malicious cyber actors are an increasing risk to our security and prosperity.  Last year, BP’s CEO stated that his company sees approximately 50,000 attempted cyber intrusions each day.   And he is not alone. </p>

<p>As you know, hackers – in many cases working for foreign states or organized criminal syndicates – break into private businesses’ servers and steal the key intellectual property that gives us a competitive edge in the global marketplace. And malicious cyber actors sometimes target companies’ infrastructure.  In 2012, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, Aramco, suffered an attack that destroyed 30,000 of its computers – nearly 75% of its workstations, a devastating loss for any company. </p>

<p>Many of these same hackers exploit vulnerabilities in software, turning home computers or servers into launch pads for malicious denial-of-service attacks against banks, companies, and government agencies – shutting them down and disrupting their ability to do business.  It does not take much imagination to see how these same tools could be used by terrorists, resulting in what has been referred to as a potential “cyber 9/11.”</p>

<p>When these attacks happen, people ask the same two basic questions many asked after the Lockerbie bombing: “What more could have been done to protect me?”  And, “are they going to get these guys?”  To answer these questions, we need the private sector and the government to work together.</p>

<p>Intrusions by nation-states have gone on longer than acknowledged.  Why are so many companies waiting to come to the government for help?  This situation is not unlike the way that organized crime was able to intimidate small businesses into paying for so-called “insurance” .  For each mom and pop store, individually, it made more sense to pay the insurance rather than face retaliation for speaking up or going to the cops.  And as a result, the criminal organizations made big profits.  They only took a small amount from each business, but the money added up over the dozens or hundreds of businesses they intimidated.  It wasn’t until the cost of doing business with the mafia got too high – or someone was brave enough to stand up to the mob – that law enforcement was able to break up these organized crime rings.</p>

<p>The calculus that many businesses make today is similar to the decisions that the mom and pop stores had to make several decades ago: Does the cost of paying out – that is, failing to tell the authorities about cyber attacks – outweigh the costs of potential retaliation?  When faced with the prospect of taking on a nation-state with all of its powers – not to mention the fear of not being able to do business in that’s nation’s marketplace – many companies have made the calculation of remaining silent.<br />
But the cost of that silence is increasing.  As valuable assets, proprietary information, and research and development investments are repeatedly compromised by increasingly relentless attacks, businesses can no longer afford to stay silent victims.  The calculus has changed.  Companies are taking action.</p>

<p>Over the last year, we have seen a tipping point.  As more and more companies come forward, more and more will feel emboldened.  Eventually, these nation-state hackers – just like the mafia – will lose the ability to intimidate victims.<br />
Public-private partnerships are particularly important because of the key role that businesses play in our society.  Unlike some countries, where government maintains control over the telecommunications and energy industries, nearly all critical infrastructure in the United States is owned and managed by private companies.  The fiber-optic cables that our communications transit; the servers that direct our Internet traffic;  the software that allows us to communicate; and the energy we use to power our daily lives – all of these things, and so many more, are created and operated by private companies.</p>

<p>We thrive as a nation because of private innovation, and the creativity that comes with the freedom to innovate.  This has been true throughout our history.  But these unique strengths also create opportunities for attacks.  When attacked, companies are often in the best position to protect themselves and their customers from cyber aggressors.  But they may not always be in the best position to know the precise threats they face, which is where we can help. </p>

<p>Take, for example, the Department’s work on cyber threats.  On a daily basis, the FBI is working with companies that have been the victims of hacks – many of whom may not even know they have been victimized, or how to protect themselves.  The Washington Post reported earlier this week that federal agents notified more than 2,000 U.S. companies last year that their computer systems were hacked – and, as the article explained, even that considerable figure represents only a fraction of the actual number of cyber intrusions into the private sector.</p>

<p>There are many efforts underway across the government to work with private corporations on strengthening public-private cyber cooperation.   The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and other departments and agencies routinely work closely with companies to protect critical infrastructure.</p>

<p> In driving this work forward, the FBI has long relied on its InfraGard program, which brings together individuals in law enforcement, government, the private sector, and academia to talk about how to protect our critical infrastructure.  InfraGard has more than 85 chapters across the country, with more than 47,000 members. </p>

<p>These are all positive and important efforts, but we have to do more.</p>

<p>As we speak, the Department of Justice is working hard to be a more accessible partner to companies.  Over the past two years, the National Security Division established a national program to focus on cyber threats to the national security – those posed by terrorist and nation state actors – and we are continuing to grow.  We are still a very new Division, but we are evolving quickly to meet new and emerging threats. </p>

<p>The story of NSD’s creation is an interesting one.  Although not formally created until 2006, NSD’s story begins, like so many others, with calls for reforms that were first spotted years ago.  We trace our origin all the way back to 1978, with the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  FISA was, in part, a response to public and congressional dissatisfaction with a series of intentional abuses of wiretaps and surveillance for political purposes.  The Church Committee’s report set out those problems and made a case for reform.  The report emphasized that the Attorney General, as the nation’s chief legal officer, plays an essential role in maintaining the lawfulness of actions by our country’s intelligence agencies.  NSD was created, and is proud, to execute that mission decades later on his behalf. </p>

<p>So as we tackle the cyber threat, we build upon our roots.  We were created so that prosecutors and law enforcement officials could work smoothly and effectively with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community, to ensure that we most effectively defend our nation’s security while at the same time protecting our vital civil liberties.  And I would be remiss in describing the vital work of our Division if I neglected to acknowledge this week’s conviction of Sulaiman Abu Ghayth in New York.  Abu Ghayth, described as a senior spokesman for Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, was convicted by a federal jury on all counts, including conspiring to kill Americans and other terrorism charges.</p>

<p>So, even as we defend our national security through successful counterterrorism prosecutions in federal court, we also defend our security while protecting our civil liberties in cyberspace.  In 2012, we established the National Security Cyber Specialists’ Network, with members from across all of our areas of expertise, federal prosecutors from each and every U.S. Attorney’s Office, and partners from the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, who have had longstanding and continuing success against organized cyber criminals, hacktivists, criminal fraudsters and other bad actors. </p>

<p>Since then, we have hosted extensive training for these network members and for every member of the National Security Division, to ensure we have the skills we need to tackle the threat.   Federal prosecutors across the country are reaching out to companies in their districts to let them know about the network and how we can help.</p>

<p>Here in our nation’s capital, we work closely with the FBI’s National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to assess cyber issues in real time as they arise.  We’ve launched a 24/7 cyber response capacity.  We are now a one-stop shop and resource for national security cyber matters across the country.</p>

<p>There are criminal cases to be brought against these actors, but that is just one tool.   We are committed to using every tool at our disposal, law enforcement and others, to disrupt adversaries’ activities and prevent damage to U.S. national interests – just as we do in other arenas of counterterrorism, counterespionage, and export control.</p>

<p>We are drawing from our expertise in those areas, and building new capabilities to ensure that we can use all available tools to meet a range of constantly-evolving threats.</p>

<p> Employing this comprehensive, “all-tools” approach means we need to be prepared not only to prosecute cyber intrusions, economic espionage, and export control violations, but also to work with our partners to enforce other civil and regulatory laws.</p>

<p>We cannot do this alone.  This “all-tools” approach requires trusted collaboration, including with operational and legal experts in the private sector.</p>

<p>It’s often said, there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be.  Now, that’s no longer the case.  Today, there is only one category:  those that have been hacked, and that will be hacked again.</p>

<p>Going forward, we want to work even more closely with our private sector partners to be ready for whatever may happen in the near future.  Of course, private companies will remain our first line of defense, and their legal teams must be prepared to face difficult questions and complex matters, including how to respond to cyber breaches; how to interpret and comply with the cyber Executive Order and the cybersecurity framework recently released by the Administration; and, how to stay on top of the evolving “standard of care” for cyber security.</p>

<p>All of us – including lawyers and operators in the public and private sectors – will need to cooperate closely to address these and associated threats.  We all must act on the premise that success requires reporting from, and close relationships with, victims and potential victims who seek indicators of malicious activity. </p>

<p>My colleagues and I have already met with a number of private entities and received a positive response, and we will continue these meetings to keep the dialogue going. </p>

<p>And as we look toward the future, we must continue establishing channels that regularly communicate cyber threat information between the public and private sectors.  Information must move in both directions.  It is an approach that works in other contexts, and it will succeed here as well.</p>

<p>We have come a long way in our collective approach to counterterrorism.  Together, we have improved airline safety, hardened critical infrastructure, developed new technology that can help first responders, and designed a wide range of protective measures.  These measures, of course, don’t eliminate the threat of to our national security, which remains very real and very dangerous.  But we are safer than we used to be, and better prepared to cope with any potential attack.</p>

<p>We need to achieve this same success in the cyber realm. So the critical question is: What will it take? </p>

<p>We’ve certainly had plenty of attacks that caused real pain, exposed real weaknesses, and suggested real problems for the future.  Yet, despite all of these warnings, we don’t seem to have fully turned the corner in addressing this threat.  And the reasons for that are understandable. </p>

<p>Confronting cyber threats incurs real economic cost.  We appreciate that.  But doing nothing will cost us all more in the long run, and may, for some businesses, prove devastating.</p>

<p>The writing is on the wall – our adversaries are getting bolder, more aggressive, and more skilled.  They flex their muscle to show us what they can do, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.  Without a concerted, collective effort to make the changes needed to protect ourselves in cyberspace, it is only a matter of time before we are really hit – hard.  Far better to form partnerships and make the required investments before a large-scale attack takes place.</p>

<p>Indeed, perhaps even more than in the terrorism context, the private sector is critical to our success in the cyber context because of just how much vital information is now held “in corporate trust,” so to speak. </p>

<p>While government holds and protects some of what cyber terrorists want to access, the private sector has much, much more.  So, whether it’s about ensuring that our electric grid is safe from attacks – whether physical or cyber – or making sure you can access your bank account information on your smartphone without getting hacked, we urgently need to form the type of public-private partnerships to keep those vital resources safe.  These are the type of partnerships we’ve created for counterterrorism.  We must build on those partnerships to combat cyber threats – not pull away from each other.</p>

<p>This is the challenge now before us – and this is the cause that everyone in this room, and many beyond it, must come together to confront.  Each of us has a unique role to play, and distinct responsibilities to fulfill. </p>

<p>Leaders in government can articulate precisely what we have to offer the private sector.  Leaders in the private sector can demonstrate what these partnerships have to offer to their customers.  And leaders in academia can survey the legal authorities we have – and take stock of what legal authorities we don’t have but need – to facilitate cooperative, productive cyber partnerships. We can build these partnerships while respecting civil liberties and do it in a transparent and productive way.</p>

<p>We are committed to meeting regularly with critical partners to get your feedback on how we are doing; to solicit suggestions on how we can do better; and to gain the benefit of your views on how the overall landscape is looking. Please reach out to us so that we can talk more about what NSD does, and how we can work together to keep you safer and our nation safer.</p>

<p>I want to close today by calling upon everyone here to continue the important open dialogue we’re holding here at AU today.  I urge you to serve as connectors – as bridges – to make private-public partnerships a reality. </p>

<p>We had warnings before 9/11.  But we didn’t act – at least not enough.  The state of security of the Internet today is a rumbling storm in the distance.  We need to be smart and work together, now, before a cyber 9/11 – before there’s an attack or intrusion or exfiltration so big – and so devastating – we are forever changed.  Thank you for participating in this important conversation, and thank you for having me here today.</p>

17,18,Remarks by Assistant Attorney General John P. Carlin on Cyber-Crime at Carnegie Mellon University,"<div>PITTSBURGH - Thanks for that kind introduction.   I’m grateful to be with you today to discuss emerging national security threats.<br /><br />
In particular, I’ll discuss cyber threats linked to a diverse range of dangerous cyber actors.   And I’ll tell you what we in the National Security Division, at the Department of Justice, are doing to counter those threats.<br /><br />
I should note at the outset that this week marks a busy time for national security law.   There is a lot going on in the world, all of which we are tracking closely.   But I’m going to focus today on the threats associated with national security cyber issues.<br /><br />
Just last week, the 9/11 Commission published its reflections on the tenth anniversary of the Commission’s original report.   And it specifically pointed to the growing significance of cyber threats to our Government and private sector.<br /><br />
In its report, the Commission noted that: “We are at September 10th levels in terms of cyber preparedness.”  They added that “American companies’ most-sensitive patented technologies and intellectual property, U.S. universities’ research and development, and the nation’s defense capabilities and critical infrastructure, are all under cyber attack.”<br /><br />
I could not agree more.<br /><br />
As the Commission concluded, “One lesson of the 9/11 story is that, as a nation, Americans did not awaken to the gravity of the terrorist threat until it was too late.   History may be repeating itself in the cyber realm.”<br /><br />
I’m particularly glad to talk about these important issues here in Pittsburgh.   In a way, this brings me back to earlier days of my cybersecurity work.<br /><br />
I began my career as a prosecutor handling a wide range of crimes, but I have spent nearly a decade focusing on cyber issues – including as the National Coordinator of the Justice Department’s Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property, or “CHIP,” program.<br /><br />
Then, I had the honor of joining FBI Director Mueller as he led a critical shift.   Even back then, he understood just how significant cyber threats would soon become.<br /><br />
Soon after arriving I was asked to prepare a speech on the FBI’s role in tackling national security cyber threats.   We saw this as an important opportunity to underscore how serious the national security cyber threat was—at a time when not many people were talking about it.<br /><br />
It was his first major FBI speech on the national security cyber threat.   Much of what the Director said that day remains true today.   We warned of the particular dangers lurking in the intersection between cyber and terrorism.<br /><br />
But we also emphasized that terrorists are not the only ones seeking to harm us online—there are other dangerous actors out there, including nation-states.   We pointed to the growing use of botnets as a way to attack networks, infect computers, and inject spyware.<br /><br />
We talked about the dangers of cyber espionage, including economic espionage.   And we explained that the FBI was mobilizing to address these threats by collaborating with partners across the Federal Government and in the private sector.<br /><br />
That speech, a significant moment in the FBI’s cyber history, was delivered just a few hours east of here, at Penn State.   Not just because of the balmy November weather it’s known for.  But rather, as explained then, because “[m]uch of our collaboration begins in Pittsburgh—at the FBI’s Cyber Fusion Center.”<br /><br />
The Director said to think of that fusion center as a hub, with spokes emanating out to federal agencies, software companies, Internet service providers, merchants, and members of the financial sector.<br /><br />
That model was right then and it is right now.<br /><br />
The fusion center, and Pittsburgh generally, is the center of so much of our cybersecurity collaboration, which is critical to our efforts to disrupt cyber threats.<br /><br />
That is why a key theme from our time near Pittsburgh nearly seven years ago was collaboration.   Back then we talked about the cooperation underway as part of Operation Bot Roast.<br /><br />
Through that project, the Justice Department, the FBI, the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon, and private companies were working to identify infected computers and shut down bot-herders.<br /><br />
Also on that trip, we visited the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, right here in Pittsburgh.   Today I came full circle.   Now I am delivering a speech about cyber in Pittsburgh.   And I spent this morning with the current FBI Director, Jim Comey, visiting NCFTA again.<br /><br />
I could scarcely have guessed back in 2007 that by today the NCFTA would have aided in successful prosecutions of more than 300 cyber criminals worldwide.   Or that it would be specifically called out by the recent 9/11 Commission Report, as “a promising example of the type of cross-sector collaboration that will be needed to combat this threat.”<br /><br />
Returning to Pittsburgh, I am struck by just how much progress we have made in seven short years.   But there is more that must be done.   Our recognition of the magnitude of the cyber threat has grown over that same time.<br /><br />
Director Comey recently said, as the torch was passed, that Director Mueller told him he believed cyber issues would come to dominate Director Comey’s tenure just as counterterrorism had dominated his.   Director Comey has continued to express FBI’s steadfast commitment to tackling cyber threats.<br /><br />
Just this morning as the FBI Director and I toured the NCFTA, he reiterated what he has said before, “John Dillinger couldn’t do a thousand robberies in the same day in all 50 states in his pajamas halfway around the world.   That’s the challenge we now face with the Internet.”<br /><br />
So the threat is real, it is here, and it is not going away.  But today, seven years later, our ability to detect, disrupt and deter has also improved.<br /><br />
Our most recent successes can be traced to the visionaries who predicted the threat years ago and laid the foundation to meet the challenge.<br /><br />
Take as just one example, another Pittsburgh story.   A historic indictment that came right out of the Western District of Pennsylvania.<br /><br />
Earlier this summer, we announced unprecedented charges against five members of the Chinese military for computer hacking, economic espionage, and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries.<br /><br />
What these charges allege is stealing from America’s heartland, literally and figuratively.<br /><br />
The charges allege that cyber thieves grabbed the hard work of companies right here in Pennsylvania.   And they allege that the thieves targeted key American economic sectors, like metals and energy.<br /><br />
This is the true face of cyber economic espionage and of those it targets.   This type of theft hurts American competitiveness by stealing what we work so hard for.<br /><br />
These charges against uniformed members of the Chinese military were the first of their kind.   Some said they could not be brought.   But this indictment alleges, with particularity, specific actions on specific days by specific actors to use their computers to steal valuable information from across our economy.<br /><br />
It alleges that while the men and women of our businesses spent their work-days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace, these members of Unit 61398 spent their work days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of our labor.<br /><br />
It alleges that they stole information particularly beneficial to Chinese companies, and took communications that would provide competitors with key insight into the strategy and vulnerabilities of the victims.<br /><br />
We should not and will not stand idly by, tacitly giving permission to anyone to steal from us.   We will hold accountable those who steal—no matter who they are, where they are, or whether they steal in person or through the Internet.<br /><br />
Because cyber crime affects us all, including those here in Pennsylvania who have suffered at the hands of cyber thieves.<br /><br />
While cases like the one brought here in Pittsburgh are extremely challenging, we proved that they are possible.   The criminal justice system is a critical component of our nation’s cyber security strategy.<br /><br />
At the Justice Department, we follow the facts and evidence where they lead.   Sometimes, the facts and evidence lead us to a lone hacker in the United States, or a sophisticated organized crime syndicate in Russia.   And sometimes, they lead us to a uniformed member of the Chinese military.<br /><br />
Other times, as we recently saw, they may lead us to a foreign businessman alleged to have conspired to hack in and steal information from Boeing and other defense contractors.<br /><br />
Information that included more than six hundred thousand data files of sensitive information related to U.S. military aircraft and other defense matters.<br /><br />
And yet other times, they may lead to other types of criminals, like those investigated and prosecuted by DOJ’s Criminal Division for spyware, botnets, and similar conduct.<br /><br />
But, no matter where they lead, there can be no free passes because the stakes are too high.   The list of threats out there is significant and it is expanding.<br /><br />
We have all seen the harms inflicted by state actors and criminals, and we have responded.   But we know they are not the only ones interested in cyber activity.<br /><br />
Terrorists are also using cyberspace to further their goals.   They are using it to communicate and plan.   They are using it for propaganda and recruitment.   And they are intent on getting to the point where they can conduct cyber attacks themselves.<br /><br />
That last category is a relatively new one.   But we know that terrorists are looking to launch cyber attacks.   They have that intent now.<br /><br />
Over the past few years, we have seen al-Qaeda issue calls for cyberattacks against networks such as the electric grid, comparing vulnerabilities in the United States’ critical cyber networks to the vulnerabilities in the country’s aviation system before 9/11.<br /><br />
If successful, terrorists could use cyber attacks to bring about economic or physical damage, or even, in extreme cases, serious injury or death.<br /><br />
These are serious threats.   To disrupt them, we take an all-tools approach, deeply rooted in our Division’s history.<br /><br />
While the Pittsburgh case was the first of its kind in some ways, it was not the first charges we have brought against individuals who steal from Americans to benefit state-owned enterprises.<br /><br />
As just one example, in March, we successfully obtained a significant conviction against Walter Liew for economic espionage.<br /><br />
What Liew stole was something Americans see and use daily.   Something that does not have a national security implication.   Something that simply brings a profit.<br /><br />
Liew stole the formula for the color white from Dupont and passed it to a large Chinese state-owned company.   Just this month, he was brought to justice -- sentenced to 180 months’ incarceration and ordered to pay restitution of about half a million dollars.<br /><br />
Our success in the cyber arena builds upon a solid foundation.   But its roots go back even farther, and extend well beyond the economic espionage context.<br /><br />
NSD was created in response to the grave threat of terrorism.<br /><br />
After the devastating attacks of September 11, it became clear that the Justice Department needed to reorganize to tackle terrorism and national security threats more effectively.<br /><br />
We needed a single Division to integrate the work of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the Intelligence Community.<br /><br />
So, in 2006, Congress created the Department’s first new litigating division in almost half a century: NSD.<br /><br />
NSD works closely with partners throughout the government to ensure we leverage all available tools to combat the terrorism threat.   And we’ve proven, in that context, that the criminal justice system is a vital part of our nation’s counterterrorism strategy.<br /><br />
Just this spring, Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted by a jury in New York on eleven counts.   He was involved in an attack in Yemen in December 1998 that resulted in the deaths of four hostages.<br /><br />
And he provided material support to terrorists, including al Qaeda and the Taliban.<br /><br />
In March, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and other terrorism charges.   Abu Ghaith was the son-in-law of Usama bin Laden and a senior member of al Qaeda.   He was the face and voice of al Qaeda in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks.<br /><br />
In both of these cases, it took more than a decade; but, as a result of our integrated approach to combating terrorism, we brought these men to justice.<br /><br />
These cases are the two most recent in a long line of successful terrorism prosecutions.<br /><br />
At NSD, we took the lessons we learned from counterterrorism and applied them to our work on national security cyber threats.   In the face of escalating threats, we recognized the need to reorganize.   To integrate.<br /><br />
When I was chief of staff for Director Mueller, the FBI undertook a transformation to meet the growing cyber threat—a transformation built around the type of collaboration, coordination, and cooperation that the Director discussed in his speech right here in Pennsylvania.   In 2011, NSD did the same.<br /><br />
In late fall of 2011, ten years after 9/11, we established a review group to evaluate NSD’s existing work on national security threats and chart out a plan for the future.<br /><br />
Six months later, that team issued recommendations that shaped what NSD’s national security cyber program looks like today.<br /><br />
Most significantly, in 2012, we created and trained the National Security Cyber Specialists’ Network to focus on combating cyber threats to the national security.<br /><br />
This Network—known as NSCS—includes prosecutors from every U.S. Attorney’s Office around the country, along with experts from the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (or “CCIPS”) and attorneys from across all parts of NSD.<br /><br />
Adopting the successful counterterrorism model, we now have prosecutors nationwide routinely meeting with the FBI to review intelligence and investigative files.<br /><br />
The creation of the NSCS Network was motivated by a desire to increase the Department’s contribution to U.S. cybersecurity efforts through criminal investigation and prosecution.<br /><br />
By December 2012, we made public predictions that with the establishment of the NSCS—by empowering more than a hundred prosecutors in the field working with the FBI on these cases—one would be brought.<br /><br />
And, in May, we made good on that promise.   It is this new, integrated approach that made the Pittsburgh case possible.<br /><br />
As part of the creation of the NSCS, we brought prosecutors from around the country—Wisconsin, New York, and Georgia—to help NSD build this case.<br /><br />
We partnered with colleagues across the government, like U.S. Attorney David Hickton here in the Western District of Pennsylvania, where entities were repeatedly hit.   And we worked with offices across the FBI—from California, to Oregon, to Oklahoma, and back in D.C.<br /><br />
Our team thought creatively.   They worked collaboratively.   They explored all available options for stopping this activity.<br /><br />
That’s how we were able to indict five members of the Third Department of the People’s Liberation Army.   And now these men stand accused of cyber intrusions targeting a range of U.S. industries.<br /><br />
But we recognize that charges are just one tool – albeit a very effective one – in our toolbox.   We are committed to working with our colleagues throughout the government to ensure we bring all tools to bear to disrupt cyber threats – both criminal and national security.<br /><br />
A great example is yet another Pittsburgh story.   Back in June, our colleagues in the Criminal Division, the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the Bureau undertook an operation that disrupted the GameOver Zeus botnet.<br /><br />
This criminal threat was significant – losses attributable to the botnet were estimated to be more than $100 million.   But disruption involved more than just criminal charges – it also involved civil court orders, significant information sharing, and seizures of servers in many foreign countries.<br /><br />
This is just one example.   In the national security context, we look to the viability of sanctions, designations, diplomatic options, and other enforcement mechanisms.   Through collaboration and creative thinking, our toolset continues to grow.<br /><br />
But we at NSD recognize that stopping attacks before they ever take place is the ultimate goal.   That we will succeed when there are no more criminal charges to bring.<br /><br />
To that end, we also worked hard to improve cyber defenses, both in Government and with the private sector.   We’ve emphasized precisely the type of collaboration that Director Mueller discussed here in Pennsylvania seven years ago.<br /><br />
Through the FBI’s InfraGard, the FBI works closely with companies that have been the victims of hackers.<br /><br />
That program, which has grown to more than 25,000 active members, continues to bring together individuals in law enforcement, government, the private sector, and academia to talk about how to protect our critical infrastructure.<br /><br />
Likewise, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and other departments and agencies routinely work closely with companies to protect critical infrastructure.<br /><br />
We at the Justice Department heard from such companies.  And we are taking steps to respond to the concerns of the private sector.<br /><br />
In April, we teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a policy statement making it clear that antitrust law is not and should not be a bar to legitimate cyber security information sharing.<br /><br />
And in May, the Justice Department issued a white paper, which clarifies that the Stored Communications Act doesn’t ordinarily restrict network operators from sharing certain data with the Government to guard information.<br /><br />
This guidance will help the private sector collaborate more freely to protect itself.<br /><br />
All of this is just a start.   Going forward, we need legislation to facilitate greater information sharing between the private sector and the government.<br /><br />
In conclusion, we’ve come a long way in seven years.<br /><br />
In Pennsylvania seven years ago, we warned that “[c]yber criminals and terrorists seek to harm our economy, our infrastructure, and our way of life.”   That was true then; and it’s even more true now.<br /><br />
We noted that “[o]ur capabilities are strong, but they rely on key partnerships with other federal agencies, law enforcement, private industry, academia, and citizens alike.”   That was true then; and it’s even more true now.<br /><br />
Finally, the Director of the FBI issued an imperative: “we must continue to work closely with all of you—members of the privacy sector and the academic community.”<br /><br />
I’m here today with a new FBI Director to reaffirm that call.   Because it was true then; and, as the 9/11 Commission’s recent report makes clear, it’s even more true now.<br /><br />
Through charges like the ones announced in the Pittsburgh case, we at the Justice Department continue to protect Americans from being victimized through cyberspace as they were here in Pittsburgh.   We need your support.   Talk with us; share with us; work with us.   Build trust.<br /><br />
Together, we can ensure that, here in America’s heartland and throughout this country, the hard work of Americans doesn’t fall prey to cyber criminals.   Together, we can stay connected, and also stay safe.<br /><br />
Thank you for your attention.   I look forward to your questions.<br />

18,19,"U.S. Marshals, Interpol Nab Fugitive from El Salvador in California","<p> </p>

<p class=""rtecenter""><img alt=""Salvadoran national, Gerardo Francisco Mejia Coto, captured"" src=""/sites/default/files/press-releases/images/2014/08/08/mejiacoto.jpg"" style=""height:276px; width:750px"" title=""Salvadoran national, Gerardo Francisco Mejia Coto, captured"" /></p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> - An investigation spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals International Investigations Branch and the Fugitive Division of Interpol Washington, U.S. National Central Bureau, resulted in the arrest of Gerardo Francisco Mejia Coto, a member of  a vicious group of kidnappers, assailants, and bank robbers known as  the “Tacoma Cabrera” gang, in California.</p>

<p>“The arrest of Gerardo Francisco Mejia Coto clearly demonstrates the commitment of the United States Marshals Service to pursue those wanted on an international level,” said U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia Hylton. “The capture of this dangerous individual in the United States sends a strong message to criminals around the globe that domestic and international law enforcement cooperation and resources are substantial, and that crossing global boundaries to avoid apprehension for heinous crimes committed elsewhere, is no longer a viable option.”</p>

<p>Tuesday, Aug. 5, members of the U.S. Marshals Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force, which includes officers from the Department of Homeland Security Enforcement Removal Operations as well as several other federal, state, and local authorities, alongside the Redwood City Police Department and the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, took Mejia Coto into custody without incident. He is being detained pending review. In addition to any charges Mejia Coto may face in the United States, he is also looking at the possibility life imprisonment in El Salvador for the crimes of murder, attempted murder, aggravated theft, and aggravated robbery.</p>

<p>In July 2007, El Salvador issued an Interpol Red Notice indicating that Mejia Coto was a key figure in the gang, helping to organize and execute numerous bank robberies and armored car hijackings, that ultimately resulted in the death of two persons and the injuring of numerous others.</p>

<p>Mejia Coto’s involvement with the Tacoma Cabrera gang dates back several years, as he is believed to be a founding member. Between 2000 and 2001 alone, Mejia Coto and others allegedly committed no less than 15 armored car and bank robberies. Additionally, the gang frequently hijacked arms and weapons shipments destined for the El Salvadorian Military and Police, the contents of which were later used to facilitate the robberies. Documented press releases in Central America of the previous crimes, describe how Mejia Coto was known for his “safe-cracking and high speed getaway driving skills.” It was not uncommon for the gang to execute the robberies with maximum force to insure a successful heist by utilizing hand grenades, AK-47 and M-16 automatic rifles, in addition to other similar high powered weaponry.</p>

<p>After being actively sought by El Salvadorian authorities for his participation in the crimes, Mejia Coto fled the jurisdiction. Over the course of the several years, he assumed multiple identities and aliases in order to evade capture.</p>

<p>The fugitive investigation gained significant momentum when a criminal investigator from the USMS Northern District of California, who was working on a detail at Interpol Washington, was able to use resources available to him to further the hunt. Familiar with the previous unsuccessful attempts to locate the fugitive, and armed with new information, the investigator was able to determine Mejia Coto's possible location in California in a very short period of time, which ultimately led to his arrest.</p>

<p>“The U.S. Marshals fugitive task force in the San Francisco Bay Area brings a wide mix of specialties and expertise to the table, as demonstrated time and again with the quality of arrests made by our officers,” said U.S. Marshal of the Northern District of California Don O’Keefe. “We have and will continue to tirelessly pursue wanted and dangerous individuals. No matter where they go or what border they cross, rest assured that we will track them down and return them to justice, wherever that may be.”</p>

<p>“Mejia Coto’s arrest illustrates how powerful and effective the working relationships between Interpol Washington and its partner agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service and ICE/ERO, can be when combatting transnational crime and terrorism,” said Interpol Washington Director Shawn A. Bray.  “In support of our partners, we continue to leverage the Interpol Notice Program and resources to share critical law enforcement information with foreign counterparts that is vital to the success of these international investigations and arrests.”</p>

<p>The efforts of the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, the Redwood City Police Department, the San Mateo Police Department, the Department of Homeland Security ICE-ERO National Fugitive Operations Program, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force participating member agencies all contributed to Mejia Coto arrest.</p>

22,23,"Former Chief Operating Officer Pleads Guilty in $132 Million Scheme 
to Defraud Clients of Funds Allegedly Held in Trust","  <p>  WASHINGTON - A former chief operating officer of Investment Properties of America, based in Richmond, Va., pleaded guilty today to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and to making a material false statement to federal investigators, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Dana Boentefor the Eastern District of Virginia announced.</p>    <p>  On July 10, 2008, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Lara Coleman, 40, for her role in a scheme to defraud and obtain millions of dollars in client funds held by the 1031 Tax Group (1031TG), a qualified intermediary company owned by the same person who owned Investment Properties of America.</p>    <p>  Coleman, a resident of Houston, entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Richmond before U.S. District Judge Robert E. Payne. Coleman pleaded guilty to one count of the superseding indictment that charged her with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to a one-count information charging her with making a material false statement to federal investigators.</p>    <p>  According to the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman and others used 1031TG and its subsidiaries in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars of client funds by false pretenses. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows investment property owners to defer the capital gains tax that would otherwise be due on properties sold, if the proceeds are used to purchase new property in a specified time frame. To facilitate such exchanges, investment property owners deposit the proceeds from the sale of their property with qualified intermediaries and sign exchange agreements, which include various promises by the qualified intermediaries to clients regarding the safekeeping of exchange funds in trust.</p>    <p>  In the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman admitted that 1031TG falsely represented that it would hold client funds solely to complete the clients’ 1031 exchanges. Coleman admitted that after obtaining clients’ exchange proceeds with that false promise, she and others misappropriated approximately $132 million in client funds to support the lavish lifestyle of the owner of 1031TG, pay operating expenses for the owner’s various companies, invest in commercial real estate and purchase additional qualified intermediary companies to obtain access to additional client funds. In addition, Coleman admitted that she lied to federal investigators about statements that she had made in 2006 to internal attorneys for Investment Properties of America about the amount of money that she and others had misappropriated.</p>    <p>  Coleman has agreed, under the terms of the plea, to a sentence of 10 years in prison. At sentencing, scheduled for May 1, 2009, she also faces a $500,000 fine. In addition, the indictment seeks forfeiture of all funds and assets owned by Coleman that were derived from or connected to the misappropriation of the approximately $132 million in 1031TG funds.</p>    <p>  In related cases, Robert D. Field II and Richard E. Simring have pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to defraud 1031TG customers. Field was the chief financial officer and Simring was the chief legal officer of a holding company that was set up, in part, to oversee both Investment Properties of America and 1031TG, however neither company was ever officially made a subsidiary of the holding company. Both men are also scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, 2009.</p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Dry for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Brigham Cannon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. This continuing investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.</p>",1231218000,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-chief-operating-officer-pleads-guilty-132-million-scheme-defraud-clients-funds
23,24,Tyson Foods Pleads Guilty and Agrees to Pay Fine for OSHA Violation That Led to Worker Death,"  <p>  WASHINGTON—Tyson Foods Inc. pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Arkansas and agreed to pay the maximum fine for willfully violating worker safety regulations that led to a worker’s death in its River Valley Animal Foods (RVAF) plant in Texarkana, Ark., the Justice Department announced.</p>    <p>  According to the information filed along with a plea agreement, Tyson operated several RVAF plants that recycled poultry products into protein and fats for the animal food industry. As part of the rendering process in four of the plants, the company used high-pressure steam processors called hydrolyzers to convert the poultry feather into feather meal.</p>    <p>  Decomposition of biological material such as poultry feathers produces hydrogen sulfide gas, an acute-acting toxic substance. Employees at the Tyson facilities often were exposed to the toxic gas when working on or near the hydrolyzers, which required frequent adjustment and replacement.</p>    <p>  As of October 2003, corporate safety and regional management were aware that hydrogen sulfide gas was present in the RVAF facilities and three of the four facilities with hydrolizers had taken measures to protect employees from hydrogen sulfide gas near the hydrolyzers. However, Tyson Foods did not take sufficient steps to implement controls or protective equipment to reduce exposure within prescribed limits or provide effective training to employees on hydrogen sulfide gas at the Texarkana facility despite an identical exposure, resulting in hydrogen sulfide poisoning of an RVAF Texarkana employee in March 2002.</p>    <p>  As a result, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2003, RVAF maintenance employee Jason Kelley was overcome with hydrogen sulfide gas while repairing a leak from a hydrolyzer and later died. Another employee and two emergency responders were hospitalized due to exposure during the rescue attempt. Two employees also were treated at the scene.</p>    <p>  ""Federal laws require employers to undertake steps that limit exposure to dangerous substances like the gas that killed Jason Kelley. Tyson Foods willfully ignored these regulations and today is being held responsible,"" said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""The Justice Department takes its enforcement responsibility seriously and companies that ignore these laws and risk their employees’ lives will be prosecuted.""</p>    <p>  The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requires that employers furnish places of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. This includes taking steps to ensure that employee exposure to dangerous substances such as hydrogen sulfide gas remains within prescribed limits. Tyson Foods pleaded guilty today to a ""willful violation of an OSHA standard resulting in the death of an employee,"" the most serious offense available to OSHA.</p>    <p>  According to today’s plea agreement, Tyson Food has agreed to pay $500,000, the maximum criminal fine. The company also will serve one year probation.</p>    <p>  The investigation was conducted by the Department of Labor and prosecuted by the Justice Department's Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas under the Environmental Crimes Section’s worker endangerment initiative.</p>",1231218000,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tyson-foods-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-pay-fine-osha-violation-led-worker-death

of New Jersey Superfund Cleanup","  <p>  WASHINGTON—A multi-party settlement involving the federal government, the state of New Jersey and approximately 300 parties will ensure that clean-up efforts continue to be funded at the Combe Fill South Superfund Site Landfill (CFS) in Morris County, N.J., the Justice Department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced today.</p>    <p>  Among the many parties potentially responsible for contamination at the site are Honeywell International Inc., Warner-Lambert Company doing business as Pfizer, the Colgate-Palmolive Company as a successor to The Mennen Company, Mars Inc., and Waste Management.</p>    <p>  Under terms of a consent decree lodged in the U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., the defendants will pay at least $61 million in past costs with interest running from Dec. 8, 2007 with up to an additional $8 million as other municipal defendants join; pay more than $3.2 million for natural resource damage claims to be used for restoration projects; and purchase a $27 million annuity paying $900,000 a year for 30 years for the continued performance of the remedy.</p>    <p>  The CFS site is contaminated with both chemical wastes and refuse as a result of its use as a sanitary landfill from the early 1950s until it was closed down in 1981. A 1986 EPA Record of Decision called for the containment of the waste through a landfill cap and continuous operation of a pump and treat facility. The cap and pump and treat facility have been in place for more than 10 years. The state is currently conducting a study of the deep aquifer to determine what additional work may be required.</p>    <p>  ""Today’s agreement is an excellent result that recovers money spent by federal and state agencies to clean up contamination at the site and provides funding for the remaining work for years to come,"" said Michael Guzman, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""This legal action, which has spanned more than 10 years, is an example of the Justice Department’s dedication to protecting the environment and taxpayer dollars while holding those responsible for the costs of cleanup.""</p>    <p>  ""With this important settlement, we are recovering most of the money that EPA and the state spent to clean up this site,"" said Alan J. Steinberg, EPA Region 2 Administrator. ""This is an example of Superfund working just as it should. We went forward with the cleanup while still pursuing those responsible for the contamination, with today’s successful result.""</p>    <p>  The CFS site is located in Chester and Washington Townships in Chester, N.J.

26,27,"Columbus, Ohio, Accountant Sentenced to 120 Months for Fraud","  <p>  WASHINGTON – Dennis G. Sartain of Hilliard, Ohio, was sentenced to 120 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today. The judge found the tax loss to be more than $1million and the fraud loss to be nearly $3.7 million.</p>    <p>      </p><p>  In November 2007, a federal grand jury returned a <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ohs/Press/11-16-07-Col.pdf"">  <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">    <span style=""color:#0000ff"">  superseding indictment</span></span></a> against Sartain, charging him with conspiracy to defraud the United States, four counts of aiding in the filing of false tax returns, one count of aiding and abetting credit and loan application fraud and one count of aiding and abetting money laundering. In February 2008, Sartain pleaded guilty to all charges. According to court documents, Sartain was the accountant for two Columbus, Ohio, businesses involved in home building and real estate brokerage services.</p>      <p>  According to the indictment, Sartain conspired with others to pay the Realtors and others who worked for these two companies ""under the table."" Court documents asserted that Sartain either prepared false Forms 1099 that underreported the amount of compensation paid to the individuals working for the companies, or he did not prepare and file any Forms 1099 with the IRS reporting any compensation paid. In addition, the superseding indictment alleged that Sartain prepared or helped prepare false individual income tax returns that underreported the income earned and taxes owed by the individuals who had received payments from these companies. Finally, the indictment claimed that Sartain and others shredded and discarded documents and business records and concealed electronic records maintained on computers and memory sticks that were relevant to the investigation.</p>    <p>  Sartain also pleaded guilty to filing false individual income tax returns on behalf of himself and his wife. He did not report all of the income he was paid by one of these companies in the years 2001 through 2004. According to the superseding indictment, in two of those four years, Sartain listed his occupation as ""unemployed.""</p>    <p>  Additionally, Sartain admitted aiding in the submission of a false loan application by helping submit false payroll check stubs to a mortgage company. The false payroll stubs misrepresented the loan applicant’s position and salary for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining a mortgage.</p>    <p>  Finally, Sartain aided and abetted money laundering by engaging in conduct that contributed to a $54,295 payment to the buyer of a home sold by a local real estate business, according to court documents. That payment represented excess fraudulently obtained loan proceeds derived from the credit and loan application fraud.</p>    <p>  ""Today’s sentence shows that taxpayers who fail to comply with their federal tax obligations or assist others in doing so will pay a heavy price,"" said Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Tax Division. ""Mr. Sartain has been branded a convicted felon for the rest of his life, will spend ten years in prison, and still has to pay back all of the taxes plus interest and steep penalties.""</p>    <p>  ""Paying individuals ‘under the table’ in an effort to circumvent the tax laws is criminal activity,"" said Eileen Mayer, IRS Chief, Criminal Investigation. ""Unfortunately, there are individuals who are relentless in their efforts to thwart our nation's tax laws; however, we are equally relentless in our efforts to investigative these individuals and hold them accountable.""</p>    <p>  In addition to the charges for which he was sentenced today, Sartain faces additional charges stemming from a September 2008 indictment for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. This matter is currently scheduled for a December 2008 trial.</p>    <p>  Assistant Attorney General Hochman commended the IRS special agents who investigated the case, as well as Tax Division trial attorneys Richard M.

Capitol Waste, Inc. and the Whitmires agreed to the preliminary injunction order.</p>    <p>  The Justice Department filed suit on Oct. 8, 2008, seeking to enjoin the defendants from interfering with the administration of the Internal Revenue laws. The complaint alleges that the defendants have failed to comply fully with Capitol Waste’s employment tax, unemployment tax and income tax obligations since 2000. According to the complaint, Capitol Waste failed to pay almost $2.6 million in federal employment and unemployment taxes between 2000 and 2007.</p>    <p>  According to court documents, Capitol Waste is a commercial waste disposal business based in Sacramento County, Calif. The complaint also alleges that the Whitmires have failed to comply with their individual income tax obligations since 2000.</p>    <p>  Capitol Waste, Inc. was also ordered to file of all of its back employment, unemployment and income tax returns, and the Whitmires are required to file all of their back individual income tax returns within 90 days. The court order also prevents Capitol Waste from transferring any assets that would prevent timely payment of all present and future tax liabilities.</p>    <p>  ""All employers must comply with federal employment tax laws,"" said Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Tax Division. ""Employers face not only a federal court injunction for failing to withhold and pay federal taxes, but also significant civil penalties and, in some cases, criminal prosecution.

on Federal Hate Crime Conspiracy Charges","  <p>  WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging three Staten Island, N.Y., men with conspiring to assault African-Americans in retaliation for President-Elect Barack Obama’s election victory.</p>    <p>  Ralph Nicoletti and Michael Contreras, both 18, and Brian Carranza, 21, were arrested late Tuesday and are scheduled for arraignment today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Roanne L. Mann in Brooklyn. As alleged in the indictment and other court filings, on the night of Nov. 4, 2008, shortly after learning of Barack Obama’s election victory, the group, along with a fourth friend, decided to find African-Americans to assault.</p>    <p>  ""It is shocking and sobering that allegations of racial violence continue in this day and age,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Grace Chung Becker.  ""The Justice Department takes these allegations very seriously and the Civil Rights Division, working with U.S. Attorneys Offices across the country, will continue to use federal laws to prosecute individuals who conspire to commit such acts of violence and intimidation.""</p>    <p>  As cited in the indictment and other court filings, Nicoletti allegedly drove the other defendants to Park Hill, a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Staten Island, where they came upon a 17-year-old African-American who was walking home after watching the election at a friend’s house. One of the defendants yelled ""Obama!"" as they passed the youth, and all four men then got out of the car and beat him, using a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton. The young man, who managed to escape and run home, suffered injuries to his head and legs.</p>    <p>  The group then found an African-American man in the Port Richmond section of Staten Island and assaulted him, pushing him to the ground. The defendants also accosted a Latino man, demanding to know for whom he had voted, and later yelled profanities about Obama as they drove past an Election Night gathering of African-Americans at a hair salon.</p>    <p>  The group’s final assault involved a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American, whom they spotted walking along Blackford Avenue in Port Richmond. Nicoletti hit him with the car, causing the victim to be thrown onto the hood of the car and into the front windshield, shattering it. Although the victim survived, he was in a coma for a period of time after the attack.</p>    <p>  The charges announced today are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted, each faces a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p>    <p>  In addition to Becker, the charges were announced by Benton J. Campbell, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph M. Demarest, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office, and Raymond W. Kelly, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department.</p>    <p>  ""Violence and intimidation aimed at interfering with the constitutional rights of every citizen, including the right to vote, which is the bedrock of democracy, will not be tolerated,"" stated United States Attorney Campbell. ""Such conduct is loathsome and despicable, and those who engage in it will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We are grateful for our partnership with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section, the FBI, and the New York City Police Department, which has been vital to the success of this joint investigation and prosecution.""</p>    <p>  FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Demarest stated, ""The defendants, motivated by racial animus, committed violent assaults resulting in real, and in one case near-fatal, injuries. But the Election Night assaults, coming on the day when we participate most directly in our democracy, were also an attack on the democratic process and an affront to everyone. The FBI is committed to civil rights enforcement and policing hate crimes.""</p>    <p>  NYPD Commissioner Kelly stated, ""I want to commend the NYPD detectives and their federal partners who pursued this case, particularly NYPD Inspector Michael J. Osgood, who as Commanding Officer of the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force had the foresight to assign a special team on Election Night until 4 a.m. the next morning. These officers were able to respond quickly to the bias attacks and begin an immediate investigation. They located an eyewitness to one of the attacks, and their subsequent distribution of flyers in the Rosebank area of Staten Island over three days led to the first major break in the case. History was made on Election Day. We wanted to make sure those who tried to retaliate did not escape justice.""</p>    <p>  The government’s case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Pamela K. Chen and Margo K.

Silt and sediment from the construction activities were also discharged into streams on and off the site and flowed downstream to Pine Lake and beyond.</p>    <p>  The current owner of the property, Liberty Ridge, LLC, which is not a defendant, has agreed to implement approximately $250,000 in on-site restoration work, which will be funded by the defendants. The defendants will also pay approximately $825,000 to purchase credits to fund stream and wetland restoration projects in the region.</p>    <p>  The alleged Clean Water Act violations at the Liberty Village site, located at 5700 Candlers Mountain Road in Lynchburg, Va., occurred from July 2001 through January 2003 when the defendants cleared and graded the site, installed roads and utilities, and completed or partially built several housing units. In the process, the defendants allegedly destroyed approximately 3,765 feet of stream, and wetlands at the headwaters of tributaries to the Roanoke and James Rivers. Silt and sediment were discharged into streams on and off the site and flowed downstream to Pine Lake and beyond.</p>    <p>  These waters are important for flood control, nutrient and sediment retention, filtration, water quality improvement and maintenance of healthy aquatic ecological communities for other water bodies down stream. As the result of defendants’ actions, water now flows downstream faster and at a higher temperature, killing or stressing aquatic animals and plants.</p>    <p>  The site restoration plan requires restoration of one stream, restoration and enhancement of four ponds, installation of plantings, and eradication of invasive species in certain areas. The consent decree also prohibits future disturbances of the restoration project area. A copy of the decree will be filed with the Circuit Court in Virginia and each future deed, title, or other conveyance instrument must contain a notice stating that the property is subject to this consent decree.</p>    <p>  The consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.

In his plea, Pascual admitted that he co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P) that purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. Pascual admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 he conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Pascual also pleaded guilty to two separate schemes to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud.</p>    <p>  During the plea, Pascual admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare, that the treatments for infused or injected drugs were not medically necessary, and that he and others paid cash kickbacks to the patients for every visit to the clinic. To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Pascual stated that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.</p>    <p>  Pascual acknowledged that most patients were HIV-positive or were given false diagnoses of cancer. He stated during the plea that he and others used physicians, a physician’s assistant and phlebotomists to help facilitate the scheme. In addition, Pascual acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Pascual stated that such tampering was done to make the medical files appear legitimate.</p>    <p>  Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a durable medical equipment (DME) company in Miami from 2001 to 2003.

35,36,"Retired Army Major Pleads Guilty in Bribery Scheme
Involving Department of Defense Contracts in Kuwait","  <p>  WASHINGTON — A retired major in the U.S. Army pleaded guilty today to charges of bribery and making a false statement arising out of his activities as both a contracting specialist and a contracting officer at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from 2005 through 2007, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and Acting Assistant Attorney General Deborah A. Garza of the Antitrust Division announced.</p>    <p>  Christopher H. Murray, 41, a resident of Cataula, Ga., pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Clay D. Land in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ga., to a five-count information charging him with four counts of bribery and one count of making a false statement.</p>    <p>  According to the information, in 2005 and 2006, Murray served as a contracting specialist in the small purchases branch of the contracting office at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, where he was responsible for soliciting bids for military contracts, evaluating the sufficiency of those bids, and then recommending the award of contracts to particular contractors. In this capacity, Murray admitted he received approximately $225,000 in bribes from DOD contractors in exchange for recommending the award of contracts for various goods and services.</p>    <p>  According to the information, Murray admitted that when he returned to Kuwait in fall 2006 as a contracting officer, he received an additional $20,000 in bribes from a Department of Defense (DOD) contractor in exchange for the award of a construction contract. When confronted with evidence of his criminal conduct, Murray admitted he made false statements to federal agents investigating this matter.</p>    <p>  Murray faces up to 15 years in prison on each bribery count, as well as a criminal fine of $250,000 or three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value for each count. Murray also faces up to five years in prison on the false statement charge as well as a fine of $250,000. The maximum fines may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either amount is greater than the statutory maximum fine.</p>    <p>  ""Murray abused his position of trust by awarding contracts to those willing to pay him bribes,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich. ""There are no more important purchases made by the federal government than those of goods and services used by our men and women in uniform.  Procurement officers who sacrifice their positions of trust for the sake of personal enrichment can expect to be prosecuted.""</p>    <p>  ""The Antitrust Division will continue to vigorously prosecute those who commit bribery and other offenses, which deprive the U.S. military and, ultimately, U.S. taxpayers, of a competitive market,"" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department's Antitrust Division.</p>    <p>  ""SIGIR vigorously continues to pursue investigations into allegations of fraud in Iraq,"" said Stuart Bowen, Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. ""Maj. Murray grossly abused his position of trust, committing multiple acts of fraud for which he will now pay a just price. This successful investigation was part of ongoing cooperative efforts being carried out by SIGIR and our law enforcement partners.""</p>    <p>  Brig. Gen. Rodney Johnson of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command said this guilty plea is just another example of how seriously his criminal investigators and the U.S. Army take these criminal acts of greed and how determined he and his special agents are to bring these people to justice. ""People who do business with the U.S. military should know by now that if they violate the public’s trust and commit criminal acts, they will be caught by a team of highly-trained professionals looking for this type of criminality. We will not stand for it,"" said Johnson.</p>    <p>  ""The American public expects military officers to behave in an aboveboard manner,"" said James R. Ives, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service’s Mid-Atlantic Field Office. ""The vast majority of officers are disciplined, law abiding professionals who serve with honor. Duty, accountability, responsibility and integrity inspire their attitudes and actions. Officers who fail to live up to these standards erode public support for the military and undermine confidence in government. The Defense Criminal Investigative Service remains committed to working with the Department of Justice to ensure officials who betray the public trust are held firmly accountable.""</p>    <p>  Today’s charges represent the Department’s commitment to protecting U.S. taxpayers from procurement fraud through its creation of the National Procurement Fraud Task Force. The National Procurement Fraud Initiative, announced in October 2006, is designed to promote the early detection, prosecution, and prevention of procurement fraud associated with the increase in contracting activity for national security and other government programs.</p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Richard B.

36,37,Two Former Oregon Residents Now Residing in Arizona Indicted for Obstructing IRS Investigation and Other Tax Crimes,"<p>WASHINGTON – A federal grand jury in Portland, Ore., returned a superseding indictment against Micaela Renee Dutson and her husband, Tony Dutson, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.</p>

<p>The Dutsons were originally indicted May 8, 2008, on charges that they conspired to defraud the United States of more than $8 million and failed to file income taxes. Both pleaded not guilty to all charges on June 5, 2008.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment adds charges that the Dutsons attempted to obstruct the IRS in its attempt to enforce the tax laws by filing lawsuits, baseless liens and multiple Forms 1099-OID against IRS employees. The indictment alleges that the baseless liens claimed a debt owed by the IRS employees to the defendants totalling $1,003,680,000,000. According to the superseding indictment, the Forms 1099-OID falsely claimed payment of millions of dollars to IRS employees who were investigating the defendants.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment also includes charges that the Dutsons presented five fictitious financial obligations totalling approximately $9,903,870 for use by their clients in purported payment of IRS debts. It further includes a charge that the Dutsons willfully aided and assisted the filing of a false 2002 federal tax return by clients.</p>

<p>""This indictment shows that the government will not tolerate taxpayers’ use of bogus financial instruments to pay tax debts and IRS forms as a means to harass IRS employees,"" said Tax Division Assistant Attorney General Nathan J. Hochman. ""Under the National Tax Defier Initiative launched in April 2008, the Tax Division has committed to vigorously investigate and prosecute tax defiers and all others who use baseless arguments and fictitious documents to evade their tax liabilities.""</p>

<p>""Obstruction is a crime that does not pay in Oregon - we will aggressively investigate and prosecute attempts by those who obstruct revenue agents and officers from doing their jobs,"" said U.S. Attorney Karin J. Immergut, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.</p>

<p>""The IRS works quickly to identify and stop these nuisance schemes aimed at harassing honest taxpayers and the government,"" said IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Eileen Mayer. ""We take seriously these types of actions that attempt to impede our ability to administer efficient tax administration. Today's indictment signals our determination to hold accountable those who engage in this type of frivolous activity.""</p>

<p>Conspiracy carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Failure to file tax returns carries a maximum penalty of up to one year in prison for each offense. Obstructing the internal revenue laws carries a maximum penalty of up to three years for each offense. Using fictitious financial instruments carries a maximum penalty of up to 25 years for each count. Aiding and assisting the filing of false tax returns carries a maximum penalty of up to three years.</p>

<p>A criminal indictment is only an allegation and not evidence of guilt. Each of these defendants is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. The charges stem from an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dwight C. Holton.</p>

in Illegal Proceeds from Foreign Bribe Payments","  <p>  WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice has filed a forfeiture action against accounts worth nearly $3 million that are alleged to be the proceeds of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bribe public officials in Bangladesh and their family members in connection with various public work projects, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division announced today.</p>    <p>  The forfeiture action was filed Jan. 8, 2009, in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia against funds located in Singapore held by multiple account holders. The forfeiture complaint relates primarily to alleged bribes paid to Arafat ""Koko"" Rahman, the son of the former prime minister of Bangladesh, in connection with public works projects awarded by the government of Bangladesh to Siemens AG and China Harbor Engineering Company.  According to the forfeiture complaint, the majority of funds in Koko’s account are traceable to bribes allegedly received in connection with the China Harbor project, which was a project to build a new mooring containment terminal at the port in Chittagong, Bangladesh.</p>    <p>  ""This action shows the lengths to which U.S. law enforcement will go to recover the proceeds of foreign corruption, including acts of bribery and money laundering,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich. ""Not only will the Department, for example, prosecute companies and executives who violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, we will also use our forfeiture laws to recapture the illicit facilitating payments often used in such schemes.""</p>    <p>  Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a German corporation, and three of its subsidiaries pleaded guilty on Dec. 15, 2008, to violations of and charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Specifically, Siemens Bangladesh admitted that from May 2001 to August 2006, it caused corrupt payments of at least $5,319,839 to be made through purported business consultants to various Bangladeshi officials in exchange for favorable treatment during the bidding process on a mobile telephone project.  At least one payment to each of these purported consultants was paid from a U.S. bank account. </p>    <p>  According to the forfeiture complaint, the bribe payments from Siemens AG and China Harbor Engineering Company were made in U.S. dollars, and the illicit funds flowed through financial institutions in the United States before they were deposited in accounts in Singapore, thereby subjecting them to U.S. jurisdiction. Money laundering laws in the United States cover financial transactions that flow through the United States involving proceeds of foreign offenses, including foreign bribery and extortion.</p>    <p>  In August 2006, the President announced a National Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy to fight high-level corruption around the world.

in Connection with Violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act","<p>  WASHINGTON – Lloyds TSB Bank plc (Lloyds), a United Kingdom corporation headquartered in London, has agreed to forfeit $350 million to the United States and to the New York County District Attorney’s Office in connection with violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Doug Shulman and Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney for the New York County District Attorney’s Office, announced today. The violations relate to transactions Lloyds illegally conducted on behalf of customers from Iran, Sudan and other countries sanctioned in programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls.</p>    <p>  A criminal information was filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia charging Lloyds with one count of violating the IEEPA.  Lloyds waived indictment, agreed to the filing of the information, and has accepted and acknowledged responsibility for its criminal conduct.  Lloyds agreed to forfeit the funds as part of deferred prosecution agreements with the Department of Justice and the New York County District Attorney’s Office.</p>    <p>  Under the IEEPA, it is a crime to willfully violate, or attempt to violate, any regulation issued under the act, including the Iranian Transactions Regulations, which prohibit exportation of services from the United States to Iran, and the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, which prohibit exportation of services from the United States to Sudan.</p>    <p>  According to court documents, beginning as early as 1995 and continuing until January 2007, Lloyds, in both the United Kingdom and Dubai, falsified outgoing U.S. wire transfers that involved countries or persons on U.S. sanctions lists.  Specifically, according to court documents, Lloyds deliberately removed material information—such as customer names, bank names and addresses—from payment messages so that the wire transfers would pass undetected through filters at U.S. financial institutions.  This process of ""repairing"" or ""stripping,"" as Lloyds commonly referred to it, allowed more than $350 million in transactions to be processed by U.S. correspondent banks used by Lloyds that might have otherwise been blocked or rejected due to sanctions regulations or for internal bank policy reasons.  According to court documents, the criminal conduct by Lloyds was designed to evade, and to assist its customers in evading, U.S. economic sanctions imposed against Iran, Sudan and other countries. </p>    <p>  ""For more than 12 years, Lloyds facilitated the anonymous movement of hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S.-sanctioned nations through our financial system,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich.  ""More than $350 million moved from places such as Iran through locations around the world because Lloyds stripped identifying information from international wire transfers that would have raised a red flag at U.S. financial institutions and caused such payments to be scrutinized. The Department will continue to use criminal enforcement measures against the knowing and intentional evasion of U.S. sanctions laws, particularly where such conduct has the potential to finance terrorist activities.""</p>    <p>  ""Today's global economy demands this type of high-level coordinated approach by multiple agencies and authorities,"" said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman.  ""The IRS is proud to have shared its hallmark expertise in following the money trail in this and other increasingly sophisticated criminal schemes.  Indeed, creating new strategies and models of cooperation among governments on international tax compliance is one of my top priorities for the IRS.""</p>    <p>  The bank’s forfeiture of $175 million to the United States and $175 million to New York County will settle forfeiture claims by the Department of Justice and the state of New York related to the misconduct.  In light of the bank’s remedial actions to date and its willingness to acknowledge responsibility for its actions, the Department will recommend the dismissal of the information in two years, provided Lloyds fully cooperates with, and abides by, the terms of the agreement.</p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Assistant Chief Mia Levine and Trial Attorney Frederick Reynolds of the Criminal Division's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, which is headed by Chief Richard Weber.  The case was investigated by the IRS-Criminal Investigation’s Washington Field Division.</p>  <p>  <a href=""/criminal/pr/documents/01-09-09lloyds-attachment.pdf"">Joint Motion Containing DPA and Factual Statement</a></p>  ",1231477200,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/lloyds-tsb-bank-plc-agrees-forfeit-350-million-connection-violations-international-emergency
41,42,Sulfuric Acid Manufacturers Agree to Reduce Air Pollution at Facilities,"  <p>  WASHINGTON — Three manufacturers of sulfuric acid have agreed to spend at least $12 million on air pollution controls that are expected to eliminate more than 3,000 tons of harmful emissions annually from six production plants in Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department announced today. Chemtrade Logistics, Chemtrade Refinery Services and Marsulex also will pay a civil penalty of $700,000 under the Clean Air Act settlement.</p>    <p>  ""The companies are expected to reduce harmful air pollution by an estimated 3,000 tons per year, which is well over half of their annual emissions"" said Granta Y. Nakayama, assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. ""Today’s settlement will improve air quality for millions of people.""</p>    <p>  ""This settlement is the product of our sustained effort to bring all sulfuric acid manufacturers into compliance with the Clean Air Act,"" said Michael Guzman, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Environmental and Natural Resources Division. ""We are pleased that the cooperative effort among us, our state counterparts, the Northern Arapaho Tribe and the defendants resulted in this victory for the environment.""</p>    <p>  Between January 2010 and January 2013, at its four production facilities in Beaumont, Texas; Shreveport, La.; Tulsa, Okla; and Riverton, Wyo., Chemtrade will upgrade existing pollution control equipment called scrubbers to meet new, lower emission limits for sulfur dioxide. At its facility in Oregon, Ohio, Marsulex will improve chemical processing equipment that will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by no later than July 2011. Finally, Marsulex will install a new scrubber at Chemtrade’s sulfuric acid plant in Cairo, Ohio, to meet lower sulfur dioxide limits by July 2011.</p>    <p>  This settlement is the third nationwide compliance agreement in a Clean Air Act initiative under which the Justice Department and EPA expect to reach similar agreements with other sulfuric acid manufacturers. The first and second nationwide sulfuric acid compliance agreements were announced in 2007 with Rhodia Inc. and Dupont. As a result of the three settlements, this initiative has now secured pollution controls at 20 plants and is expected to eliminate a combined total of 35,000 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions per year.</p>    <p>  Chemtrade’s and Marsulex’s plants produce sulfuric acid by burning sulfur or used sulfuric acid, thereby creating sulfur dioxide, which poses a danger to children, the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions.</p>    <p>  The government’s complaint, filed with the consent decree, alleges that Chemtrade and Marsulex made modifications to their plants, which increased emissions of sulfur dioxide without first obtaining pre-construction permits and installing required pollution control equipment. The Clean Air Act requires major sources of air pollution to obtain such permits before making changes that would result in a significant emissions increase of any pollutant.</p>    <p>  Sulfuric acid has many applications and is one of the top products of the chemical industry. Principal uses include ore processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing and chemical synthesis.</p>    <p>  EPA is focusing on improving compliance among industries that have the potential to cause significant amounts of air pollution, including the cement manufacturing, glass manufacturing and acid production industries.</p>    <p>  The states of Louisiana, Ohio and Oklahoma, and the Northern Arapaho Tribe, joined the federal government in the agreement. Of the total penalty, $460,000 will be paid to the federal government and $240,000 will be paid to the three states. In Ohio, part of the money will be used to fund a clean diesel school bus project and a tree planting project.</p>    <p>  The consent decree, lodged today in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and approval by the federal court.</p>    <p>  More information on the settlement: <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html"">  <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">    <span style=""color:#0000ff"">  http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html</span></span></a></p>",1231736400,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/sulfuric-acid-manufacturers-agree-reduce-air-pollution-facilities

44,45,Rite Aid Corporation and Subsidiaries Agree to Pay $5 Million in Civil Penalties to Resolve Violations in Eight States of the Controlled Substances Act,"  <p>  WASHINGTON- Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) and nine of its subsidiaries in eight states have agreed to pay $5 million in civil penalties to settle allegations of violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Department of Justice announced today.</p>    <p>  In addition to the $5 million penalty, Rite Aid and all of its subsidiaries agreed to a compliance plan with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to ensure compliance with all requirements of the CSA and applicable DEA regulations and to prevent diversion of controlled substances. The compliance plan also requires Rite Aid to implement a pseudoephedrine and ephedrine tracking system in each of its 4,915 stores that is designed to prevent the abuse of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products, which are used to make methamphetamine. </p>    <p>  According to information contained in the agreement, the DEA conducted an investigation of 53 separate Rite Aid locations starting in 2004. The investigation revealed a pattern of violations of the CSA, including:</p>  <ul><li>At pharmacies in Kentucky and New York, Rite Aid knowingly filled prescriptions for controlled substances that were not issued for a legitimate medical purpose pursuant to a valid physician-patient relationship;</li>  <li>At five pharmacies in Maryland, four pharmacies in New York and 13 pharmacies in California, Rite Aid failed to notify the DEA in a timely manner of significant thefts and losses of controlled substances, thus permitting the diversion of controlled substances to continue and undermining DEA’s ability to investigate such thefts and/or losses;</li>  <li>At pharmacies in California, Pennsylvania and Maryland, Rite Aid either failed to maintain or failed to furnish to the DEA upon request records that are required to be kept under the CSA for a period of two years; </li>  <li>At all 53 pharmacies in all eight states, Rite Aid failed to properly execute DEA forms used to ensure that the amount of Schedule II drugs ordered by Rite Aid were actually received.</li>  </ul><p>  Additionally, the DEA conducted accountability audits of controlled substances at 25 of the 53 stores investigated to determine whether Rite Aid could properly account for Schedule II and III controlled substances purchased and dispensed. The results of the accountability audits revealed significant shortages or surpluses of the most highly abused drugs, including oxycodone and hydrocodone products, reflecting a pattern of non-compliance with the requirements of the CSA and federal regulations that lead to the diversion of controlled substances in and around the communities of the Rite Aid pharmacies investigated.</p>    <p>  ""Congress regulates prescription medications because of their powerful and potentially harmful effects,"" said Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip. ""Today's settlement will help to curb illegal access to these dangerous drugs that can often be abused.""</p>    <p>  </p>    <p>  ""This settlement demonstrates the important responsibilities all pharmacies have to prevent dangerous drugs from being diverted from their intended use,"" said DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""The civil penalties paid today are just one example of DEA's determination to combat the troubling prescription drug abuse problem in this country by pursuing pharmacies that fail to comply with the law. Our nation's pharmacies must play a major role in the fight against drug abuse, so that together we can protect public health and keep our communities safe.""</p>    <p>  As part of the compliance plan agreed to as part of the settlement, Rite Aid has agreed to audit each pharmacy to ensure that all of its controlled substances are maintained securely and that each pharmacy is compliant with the requirements of the CSA. Additionally, Rite Aid will physically count all Schedule II controlled substances quarterly and physically count hydrocodone and alprazolam products yearly. Currently, the CSA only requires registrants like Rite Aid to physically count Schedule II controlled substances biennially and estimate Schedule III products biennially.</p>    <p>  Rite Aid has also agreed to design and implement an electronic system to document and link all sales transactions involving non-prescription products containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine at each of the 4,915 Rite Aid locations in the country. The new system will be designed to prevent individuals from obtaining illegal amounts of these products by visiting different pharmacy locations. In the event an individual attempts to make a purchase that would exceed either the daily or 30-day limit for purchase of non-prescription products containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, the new system will alert the employee to halt the transaction and a record of the attempted purchase will be made and reported to the DEA.</p>    <p>  The CSA is the primary federal law regulating the flow of controlled substances into the marketplace for medical purposes.  Strict compliance with the CSA is required in order to prevent the illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, possession and improper use of controlled substances. The Act authorizes the imposition of a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each record keeping or reporting violation and a penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation involving legally deficient prescriptions.</p>    <p>  The settlement agreement is neither an admission of liability by Rite Aid nor a concession by the United States that its claims are not well founded.</p>    <p>  Rite Aid is headquartered in Camp Hill, Pa., and operates 4,915 stores in 31 states. Violations resolved by the settlement occurred in eight states and 11 judicial districts, including the Middle District of Pennsylvania; Eastern, Northern, and Western Districts of New York; District of Maryland; Eastern District of Kentucky; Eastern and Central Districts of California; Eastern District of Virginia; District of New Jersey; and the Eastern District of Michigan. The settlement was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from each of the 11 judicial districts in which violations occurred. Additional assistance was provided by the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section. The investigation in this matter was conducted by the DEA.</p>",1231736400,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rite-aid-corporation-and-subsidiaries-agree-pay-5-million-civil-penalties-resolve-violations

46,47,South Carolina Doctor Pleads Guilty to Filing False Tax Return,"  <p>  WASHINGTON - Peter Zavell, a medical doctor in Florence, S.C., pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false tax return for the year 2000, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service(IRS) announced today. Zavell was scheduled to begin trial in Florence before Judge R. Bryan Harwell today.</p>    <p>  Zavell was indicted in August 2007 for conspiracy to impede the IRS and for filing false returns for years 2000 and 2001. According to the indictment, Zavell used the ""Look Back"" and ""Look Forward"" programs, marketed by Anderson Ark and Associates (AAA) to create fictitious entities and business transactions intended to eliminate his tax obligations. The tax loss relative to the scheme was $244,784.</p>    <p>  According to the indictment, Zavell used the AAA Look Back program to set up a sham partnership for the purpose of reporting false expenses and eliminating his individual tax liabilities. The indictment alleges that, through the AAA Look Forward program, Dr. Zavell created a sham partnership with which his medical practiced allegedly engaged in fictitious business contracts. The purpose and result of this fictitious business relationship was to generate false business expenses for his medical practice and substantially reduce the business tax obligations.</p>    <p>  ""Dr. Zavell joins more than a dozen other AAA customers who now wear the lifelong title ‘convicted felon’ for their participation in illegal tax fraud scams,"" said Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Tax Division. ""This is just one more example of the government’s commitment to investigate and prosecute those who fail to comply with their federal tax obligations.""</p>    <p>  ""The IRS aggressively investigates those who use abusive financial arrangements to hide the true ownership of assets and income; it is a matter of maintaining public confidence in the fairness of the tax laws,"" said Eileen Mayer, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. ""If individuals choose to participate in abusive tax schemes, they will be held accountable and criminally prosecuted.""</p>    <p>  As part of the plea agreement, the government agreed to dismiss charges against Zavell’s wife, Susan Zavell.</p>    <p>  Judge Harwell did not set a sentencing date. Zavell faces up to three years in prison and a fine of $250,000.</p>    <p>  Assistant Attorney General Hochman commended the IRS special agents who investigated the case, as well as Tax Division trial attorneys Kevin C.

47,48,"KIK (Virginia) LLC Pleads Guilty and Agrees to Pay Fine
for Negligent Discharges to Sewer System","  <p>  WASHINGTON — KIK (Virginia) LLC pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Virginia to a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and agreed to pay a $75,000 criminal fine and $25,000 in community service payments for negligent discharges of bleach to the sanitary sewer system in Salem, Va.</p>    <p>  KIK (Virginia) operated a facility in Salem that manufactured bleach and other household products. On Sept. 4, 2003, local authorities discovered elevated concentrations of bleach in the sanitary sewer lines servicing the KIK (Virginia) facility. An investigation revealed that at that time and for a number of years before, under previous owners, employees at the plant washed bleach that had been spilled in the production and bottling process and off-specification bleach into the plant’s floor drains. The floor drains channeled the bleach into the plant’s drainage system, which lead to Salem’s sanitary sewer system, operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority. The plant did not have a permit to discharge bleach to the sewer system and did not monitor its discharges.</p>    <p>  The Clean Water Act prohibits discharges into a sewer system of any pollutants that the discharger knows could cause property damage. Bleach is a corrosive chemical that, in sufficient concentration, may damage metal and other materials used in the sewer system and is considered a pollutant under the Clean Water Act.</p>    <p>  ""Keeping our sewer systems and public treatment works in good condition is a key part of maintaining and improving the quality of our waterways,"" said Eileen Sobek, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""We take seriously our obligation to prosecute those whose conduct risks harm to these important systems.""</p>    <p>  The $25,000 in community service payments will be divided equally between the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the National Environmental Education Fund for use in projects to improve water quality in the Salem area. In addition to the criminal fine and community service payment, KIK (Virginia) has agreed to serve one year of probation, during which it will continue to develop and implement an environmental management system that it began developing during the investigation. It also will complete an environmental audit conducted by an independent auditor.</p>    <p>  ""Dumping bleach into the city's sewer system risked causing damage to both its sewage treatment equipment and the environment,"" said David Dillion, EPA's Special Agent in Charge in Philadelphia. ""It is appropriate that, in addition to the fine, the company will be required</p>    <p>  to institute a management system so that this never happens again.""</p>    <p>  The investigation was conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency with assistance from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and members of the Blue Ridge Environmental Task Force, and was prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia.</p>",1231822800,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/kik-virginia-llc-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-pay-fine-negligent-discharges-sewer-system
48,49,"Justice Department Settles Civil Contempt Claim
Against AT&T Inc.","  <p>  WASHINGTON – AT&amp;T Inc. has agreed to pay more than $2 million as part of a civil settlement with the Department of Justice that resolves AT&amp;T’s alleged violations of two court orders entered in connection with AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Dobson Communications Corporation.</p>    <p>  The Department today filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia asking it to find AT&amp;T in civil contempt of a 2008 consent decree and a related court order. At the same time, the Department filed a settlement agreement and order, subject to court approval, that would resolve the Department’s concerns. The payment to the United States includes reimbursement to the government for the cost of its investigation into AT&amp;T’s alleged violations.</p>    <p>  ""It is imperative that companies fully abide by their court-ordered obligations in order for our settlements to be effective in preserving competition and protecting consumers,"" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division. ""When companies fail to comply with a court order, the Antitrust Division will take swift and certain action to ensure that companies fulfill their responsibilities.""</p>    <p>  Under the consent decree entered by the court in March 2008, AT&amp;T was required to divest mobile wireless telecommunications businesses in three rural service areas (RSAs) – two in Kentucky and one in Oklahoma. Pending divestiture, a management trustee was appointed to oversee the businesses to be divested. Under the consent decree and a related court order, AT&amp;T was required to take all steps necessary to ensure that the divested businesses were operated independently of AT&amp;T and that AT&amp;T did not influence how they were managed. AT&amp;T was also required to take all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of information material to the operation of the divested businesses and not give unauthorized personnel access to such information.</p>    <p>  According to the petition filed by the Department, AT&amp;T failed to fulfill its obligations under the two court orders. The petition alleges that AT&amp;T failed to separate confidential customer account information of the divested businesses from its own customer records and to take other actions needed to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Consequently, AT&amp;T personnel obtained unauthorized access to the divested businesses’ competitively sensitive customer information and in some situations used it to solicit and win away the divested businesses’ customers. The petition further alleges that AT&amp;T, without authorization by the management trustee, waived early termination fees for several customers of the divested businesses to facilitate switching their wireless service from the divested businesses to AT&amp;T.</p>    <p>  Certain provisions of the orders were adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its Nov. 15, 2007 order approving the merger of AT&amp;T and Dobson. The Department has coordinated with the FCC throughout its investigation.</p>    <p>  AT&amp;T, headquartered in Dallas, is the largest provider of mobile wireless voice and data services in the United States, serving approximately 73 million customers.</p>",1231909200,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-civil-contempt-claim-against-att-inc

According to information contained in plea documents, Cross admitted he had access to official State Department computer databases in the regular course of his employment, including the Passport Information Electronic Records System (PIERS), which contains, among other data, all imaged passport applications dating back to 1994. The imaged passport applications on PIERS contain, among other things, a photograph of the passport applicant as well as certain personal information including the applicant’s full name, date and place of birth, current address, telephone numbers, parent information, spouse’s name and emergency contact information.

Collier, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida Thomas F. Kirwin and FBI Executive Assistant Director J. Stephen Tidwell announced.</p>    <p>  The federal jury convicted the defendants of multiple charges, including: engaging in a child exploitation enterprise; conspiracy to advertise, transport, ship, receive and possess child pornography; advertising child pornography, transporting child pornography, receiving child pornography and obstruction of justice.</p>    <p>  ""This was a wide-scale, high volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division. ""Those who operate such enterprises can expect law enforcement, not only here but abroad, to react swiftly and aggressively, as we have done here."" </p>    <p>  The defendants convicted at trial were: James Freeman of Santa Rosa Beach, Fla.; Gary Lakey of Anderson, Ind.; Marvin Lambert of Indianapolis; Neville McGarity of Medina, Texas; Warren Mumpower of Spokane, Wash.; Daniel Castleman of Lubbock, Texas; and Ronald White of Burlington, N.C.</p>    <p>  Seven additional U.S. defendants, also indicted in the case, previously pleaded guilty to offenses related to the child pornography enterprise. Members of the highly-sophisticated international network were charged in a 40-count superseding indictment on March 19, 2008.</p>    <p>  Evidence presented at trial, including approximately 50 witnesses and 500 exhibits, established that the defendants participated in a well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period. According to trial testimony, members of the illegal organization used Internet newsgroups - large file-sharing networks where text, software, pictures and videos can be traded and shared - to traffic in illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts. Specifically, an Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 testified about how group members employed a complex system of pseudonyms, screening tests for new members and sophisticated encryption methods to avoid detection. He also testified that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before it was dismantled by law enforcement.</p>    <p>  Each defendant convicted at trial faces a minimum prison sentence of 20 years and a maximum of life in prison, in addition to statutory fines and the possibility of a lifetime period of supervised release following completion of any prison sentence. Sentencing is set April 14, 2009, for all defendants convicted today.</p>    <p>  On the return of the guilty verdicts, Acting U.S. Attorney Kirwin said, ""This jury verdict signals, once again, the community’s reprehension for the culture of abuse and torture that is child pornography. I am as proud as I can be of our investigative and trial team for the hard work and countless hours they devoted to the investigation and successful prosecution of this scourge. This was truly a team effort by U.S. and foreign law enforcers and by prosecutors from our office and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section.

53,54,Eli Lilly and Company Agrees to Pay $1.415 Billion to Resolve Allegationsof Off-label Promotion of Zyprexa,"<p>American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.</p>

<p>Eli Lilly agreed to enter a global resolution with the United States to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it promoted its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA, the Department said. Such unapproved uses are also known as ""off-label"" uses because they are not included in the drug’s FDA approved product label.</p>

<p>Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Gregory G. Katsas and acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Laurie Magid today announced the filing of a criminal information against Eli Lilly for promoting Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, is charged in the information with promoting Zyprexa for such off-label or unapproved uses as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, in elderly people.</p>

<p>The company has signed a plea agreement admitting its guilt to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Eli Lilly also signed a civil settlement to resolve civil claims that by marketing Zyprexa for unapproved uses, it caused false claims for payment to be submitted to federal insurance programs such as Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, none of which provided coverage for such off-label uses.</p>

<p>The plea agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay a criminal fine of $515 million and forfeit assets of $100 million. The civil settlement agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay up to an additional $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve civil allegations originally brought in four separate lawsuits under the <em>qui tam </em>provisions of the federal False Claims Act. The federal share of the civil settlement amount is $438 million. Under the terms of the civil settlement, Eli Lilly will pay up to $361 million to those states that opt to participate in the agreement.</p>

<p>Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to the FDA. Before approving a drug, the FDA must determine that the drug is safe and effective for the use proposed by the company. Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses.</p>

<p>The FDA originally approved Zyprexa, also known by the chemical name olanzapine, in Sept. 1996 for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders. In March 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short term treatment of schizophrenia in place of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. Also in Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for approximately eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months. Zyprexa has never been approved for the treatment of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia.</p>

<p>The criminal information, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from Sept. 1999 through at least Nov. 2003, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for the treatment of agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder. The information alleges that Eli Lilly’s management created marketing materials promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, trained its sales force to disregard the law and directed its sales personnel to promote Zyprexa for off-label uses.</p>

<p>The information alleges that beginning in 1999, Eli Lilly expended significant resources to promote Zyprexa in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, primarily through its long-term care sales force. Eli Lilly sought to convince doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to treat patients with disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and behavioral symptoms such as agitation, aggression, and hostility.</p>

<p>The information further alleges that the FDA never approved Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, or the cognitive deficits associated with dementia.</p>

<p>The information also alleges that building on its unlawful promotion and success in the long-term care market, Eli Lilly executives decided to market Zyprexa to primary-care physicians. In Oct. 2000, Eli Lilly began this off-label marketing campaign targeting primary care physicians, even though the company knew that there was virtually no approved use for Zyprexa in the primary-care market. Eli Lilly trained its primary-care physician sales representatives to promote Zyprexa by focusing on symptoms, rather than Zyprexa’s FDA approved indications.</p>

<p>The <em>qui tam </em>lawsuits alleged that between Sept. 1999 and the end of 2005, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for use in patients of all ages and for the treatment of anxiety, irritability, depression, nausea, Alzheimer’s and other mood disorders. The <em>qui tam </em>lawsuits also alleged that the company funded continuing medical education programs, through millions of dollars in grants, to promote off-label uses of its drugs, in violation of the FDA’s requirements.</p>

<p>""Off-label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious crime because it undermines the FDA’s role in protecting the American public by determining that a drug is safe and effective for a particular use before it is marketed,"" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. ""This settlement demonstrates the Department’s ongoing diligence in prosecuting cases involving violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and recovering taxpayer dollars used to pay for drugs sold as a result of off-label marketing campaigns.""</p>

<p>""When pharmaceutical companies ignore the government’s process for protecting the public, they undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and place innocent people in harm’s way,"" said acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Laurie Magid. ""Off-label marketing created unnecessary risks for patients. People have an absolute right to their doctor’s medical expertise, and to know that their health care provider’s judgment has not be clouded by misinformation from a company trying to build its bottom line.""</p>

<p>The global resolution includes the following agreements:</p>

<ul><li>A plea agreement signed by Eli Lilly admitting guilt to the criminal charge of misbranding. Specifically, Eli Lilly admits that between Sept. 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.</li>
	<li>A civil settlement between Eli Lilly, the United States and various States, in which Eli Lilly will pay up to $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve False Claims Act claims and related state claims by Medicaid and other federal programs and agencies including TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health Service Entities. The federal government will receive $438,171,544 from the civil settlement. The state Medicaid programs and the District of Columbia will share up to $361,828,456 of the civil settlement, depending on the number of states that participate in the settlement.</li>
	<li>The <em>qui tam </em>relators will receive $78,870,877 from the federal share of the settlement amount.</li>
	<li>A Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.</li>
</ul><p>""OIG’s Corporate Integrity Agreement will increase the transparency of Eli Lilly’s interactions with physicians and strengthen Eli Lilly’s accountability for its compliance with the law,"" said Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. ""This historic resolution demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improvethe integrity of drug promotion activities.""</p>

<p>In addition to the $1.415 billion criminal and civil settlement announced today, Eli Lilly previously agreed to pay $62 million to settle consumer protection lawsuits brought by 33 states. The state consumer protection settlements were announced on Oct. 7, 2008.</p>

<p>""Today's announcement of the filing of a criminal charge and the unprecedented terms of this settlement demonstrates the government's increasing efforts aimed at pharmaceutical companies that choose to put profits ahead of the public's health,"" said Special Agent-in-Charge Kim Rice of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. ""The FDA will continue to devote resources to criminal investigations targeting pharmaceutical companies that disregard the safeguards of the drug approval process and recklessly promote drugs for uses for which they have not been proven to be safe and effective.""</p>

<p>""The illegal scheme used by Eli Lilly significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's healthcare system,"" said Ed Bradley, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service. ""This illegal activity increases patients’ costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members, retirees and their families who rely on this system. Today’s charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners in law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the government's healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients.""</p>

<p>""This case should serve as still another warning to all those who break the law in order to improve their profits,"" said Patrick Doyle, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia.  ""OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will pursue and bring to justice those who would steal from vulnerable beneficiaries and the taxpayers.""</p>

<p>The civil settlement resolves four <em>qui tam</em> actions filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania: <em>United States ex rel. Rudolf, et al., v. Eli Lilly and Company,</em> Civil Action No. 03-943 (E.D. Pa.)<em>; United States ex rel. Faltaous v. Eli Lilly and Company,</em> Civil Action No. 06-2909 (E.D. Pa.)<em>; United States ex rel. Woodward v. Dr. George B. Jerusalem, et al.,</em> Civil Action No. 06-5526 (E.D. Pa.)<em>; </em>and<em> United States ex rel. Vicente v. Eli Lilly and Company, </em>Civil Action No. 07-1791 (E.D. Pa.). All of those cases were filed by former Eli Lilly sales representatives.</p>

<p>The criminal case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Office of Consumer Litigation of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. The civil settlement was reached by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.</p>

<p>This matter was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.</p>

<p>Assistance was provided by representatives of FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units.</p>

<p>The Corporate Integrity Agreement was negotiated by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Eli Lilly's guilty plea and sentence is not final until accepted by the U.S. District Court.</p>

54,55,Medical Clinic Executives and Worker Plead Guilty to $5.3 Medicare Fraud Scheme,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.</p>    <p>  </p>    <p>  Juan A. ""Tony"" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).</p>    <p>  Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.</p>    <p>  During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.</p>    <p>  To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.</p>    <p>  The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.</p>    <p>  On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.</p>    <p>  On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.</p>    <p>  Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars.</p>",1231995600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medical-clinic-executives-and-worker-plead-guilty-53-medicare-fraud-scheme
55,56,"Alabama-Based Hospice Company Pays U.S. $24.7 Million
to Settle Health Care Fraud Claims","  <p>  WASHINGTON – SouthernCare Inc. and its shareholders have agreed to pay the United States a total of $24.7 million to settle allegations that the Birmingham, Ala.-based company submitted false claims to the government for patients treated at its hospice facilities, the Justice Department announced today. SouthernCare operates approximately 99 locations that provide hospice services in 15 states.</p>    <p>  Hospices provide palliative care – any form of medical care or treatment that concentrates on reducing the severity of a disease’s symptoms – to patients who decide to forego curative care of their illness. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to hospice care if they have a terminal prognosis of six months or less to live. The government alleged that SouthernCare was submitting false claims for hospice care for patients who were not eligible for such care.</p>    <p>  ""The Medicare hospice benefit is intended to provide compassionate end of life care to terminally ill patients,"" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. ""This settlement sends a clear message that the Department of Justice will not allow health care providers to take advantage of beneficiaries in their attempts to game the reimbursement system.""</p>    <p>  Today’s settlement results from two qui tam suits filed by two former SouthernCare employees, Tanya Rice and Nancy Romeo, on behalf of the United States. The False Claims Act authorizes private parties to file suit against those who defraud the United States and to receive a share of any recovery. The United States will pay $4.9 million to the individuals who filed the actions against SouthernCare.</p>    <p>  ""Our investigation showed a pattern and practice to falsely admit patients to hospice care who did not qualify and to bill Medicare for that care. This resulted in taxpayers bearing inappropriate costs. Today’s settlement evidences the Department of Justice’s efforts to both protect the public monies and safeguard Medicare beneficiaries,"" said Alice H. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>    <p>  ""This significant settlement demonstrates our commitment to protect the Medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse and to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care,"" said David E. Nahmias, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,. ""Every provider that submits claims to the Medicare program must ensure that its services are billed appropriately. Falsely admitting people to hospice care who did not qualify for the benefit exposed these patients to potential harm and contributes to the soaring costs of health care for everyone.""</p>    <p>  As part of the settlement, SouthernCare will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to address the allegations raised in the qui tam complaints.</p>    <p>  ""Today’s Corporate Integrity Agreement contains rigorous provisions specifically designed to ensure SouthernCare’s future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid hospice eligibility requirements,"" said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for HHS. ""This agreement demonstrates OIG’s commitment to protect the integrity of federal health care programs.""</p>    <p>  The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northen District of Georgia, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI.</p>",1231995600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alabama-based-hospice-company-pays-us-247-million-settle-health-care-fraud-claims

Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>    <p>  Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>    <p>  According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:</p>    <p>  The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>    <p>  After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.</p>    <p>  As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>    <p>  Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.</p>    <p>  ""Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. ""This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.""</p>    <p>  William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: ""These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.""</p>    <p>  C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: ""This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.  Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.""</p>    <p>  This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments. </p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E.

58,59,CEMEX California Cement Agrees to Reduce Emissions and Pay $2 Million Fine to Settle Clean Air Act Claims,"  <p>  WASHINGTON—In the largest settlement yet in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.</p>    <p>   The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.  Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.  The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.  EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.</p>    <p>   “Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>    <p>    “This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.  “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”</p>    <p>   The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide. </p>    <p>      Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.  The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.</p>    <p>   The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.  A copy of the consent decree is available on the Department of Justice Web site at <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html"">http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html</a>.  For more information on the settlement and the Clean Air Act, please visit: <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html"">http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html</a>.</p>",1231995600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cemex-california-cement-agrees-reduce-emissions-and-pay-2-million-fine-settle-clean-air-act

According to the defendants and their co-conspirators, a business opportunity purchaser would earn substantial profits when members of the public purchased prepaid cell phones, phone minutes and various prepaid products and services from a distributor’s kiosk terminal.</p>    <p>  Global promoted the business opportunities to consumers across the country through television commercials and other media, touting the profits that could be earned by purchasing a distributorship and urging consumers to call a telephone number that appeared in the advertisements. Potential purchasers were told that for a purchase price of approximately</p>    <p>  $15,000 Global would provide three terminals, numerous prepaid cell phones and advertising material. Global salespeople told consumers that Global would find viable, high-traffic locations to place the terminals, relocate any terminals that underperformed, only sell distributorships in a limited geographic area, and provide ongoing technical support and customer service.

De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.</p>    <p>  De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.</p>    <p>  De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.</p>    <p>  Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.</p>    <p>  ""Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M.

Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font. Goachet also admitted that in August 2008 he falsely claimed in an interview with the FBI that the invoices were legitimately written for services rendered to the businessman and denied that the money was intended for De Castro Font.</p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline Novas and Timothy R.

72,73,Chicago Police Officer Pleads Guilty to Violating Federal Civil Rights of a Man Beaten While Restrained in a Wheelchair,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – A Chicago police officer pleaded guilty today to violating the federal civil rights of a man whom the officer struck repeatedly with a dangerous weapon while the man was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Loretta King, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald and Robert D. Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.</p>    <p>  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25<sup>th</sup> District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.</p>    <p>  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a ""sap,"" a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.</p>    <p>  ""The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  ""This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force.""</p>    <p>  ""No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force,"" U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.</p>    <p>  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.</p>    <p>  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.</p>    <p>  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an ""open hand strike"" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.</p>    <p>  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S.

73,74,Twentieth Member of Casino-cheating Criminal Enterprise Pleads Guilty to Racketeering Conspiracy Targeting Casinos in the United States and Canada,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the ""Tran Organization,"" in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.</p>    <p>  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>    <p>  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:</p>  <ul><li>Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;</li>  <li>Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;</li>  <li>Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;</li>  <li>Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;</li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;</li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;</li>  <li>Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;</li>  <li>Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;</li>  <li>Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;</li>  <li>Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;</li>  <li>Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and </li>  <li>Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.</li>  </ul><p>  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a ""false shuffle"" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating ""slugs"" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a ""false shuffle,"" and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.</p>    <p>  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.</p>    <p>  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>    <p>  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge. Tran agreed to a personal money judgment in the amount of $180,000, which will be entered by way of a preliminary order of forfeiture. He also acknowledged that the restitution that he may be ordered to pay by the court at sentencing is not limited by the forfeiture amount. Tran was also charged in Orillia, Ontario, Canada, for his admitted cheating activities at Casino Rama.</p>    <p>  A second indictment has alleged that 11 additional defendants conspired to commit offenses on behalf of the Tran Organization. A one-count indictment, unsealed in the Southern District of California on Sept. 11, 2008, charged Bryan Arce; Don Man Duong; Hogan Ho; Thang Viet Huynh; Outtama Keovongsa; Leap Kong, a/k/a Lanida Kong; Qua Le; Khunsela Prom, a/k/a Danny Prom; James Root; Darrell Saicocie; and Dan Thich each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos, and conspiracy to travel in interstate and foreign commerce in aid of racketeering.</p>    <p>  To date, 20 defendants, including Tran, have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the casino-cheating conspiracy: Phuong Quoc Truong; Anh Phuong Tran; Martin Lee Aronson; Liem Thanh Lam; George Michael Lee; Tien Duc Vu; Son Hong Johnson; Barry Wellford; Willy Tran; Tuan Mong Le; Duc Cong Nguyen; Han Truong Nguyen; Roderick Vang Thor; Sisouvanh Mounlasy; Navin Nith; Renee Cuc Quang; Ui Suk Weller; Phally Ly; and Khunsela Prom. These defendants admitted to targeting, with the aid of coconspirators, a combined total of approximately 24 casinos during the course of the conspiracy.</p>    <p>  The case is being investigated by the FBI’s San Diego Field Office; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; the San Diego Sheriff’s Department; and the California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Gambling Control. The investigation has received assistance from federal, state, tribal and foreign authorities, including: the Ontario Provincial Police; the National Indian Gaming Commission; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington; FBI Resident Agencies in Gulfport, Miss., Tacoma, Wash., and Toledo, Ohio; the Indiana State Police; the Rumsey Rancheria Tribal Gaming Agency; the Sycuan Gaming Commission; the Barona Gaming Commission; the Mississippi Gaming Commission; and the Washington State Gambling Commission.</p>    <p>  The prosecution of the case is led by the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS).

76,77,Canadian Company to Pay U.S. More Than $1 Million Related to Sale of Defective Bullet-proof Vests,"  <p>  WASHINGTON - Barrday Inc. and two related companies have agreed to pay the United States more than $1 million to resolve allegations that they violated the False Claims Act in connection with their role in the weaving of Zylon fabric used in the manufacture and sale of defective Zylon bullet-proof vests, the Justice Department announced today. Barrday, headquartered in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, is a weaver of ballistic fabrics and designs and produces specialty industrial textiles.</p>    <p>  The United States alleged that Barrday’s woven Zylon fabric was used in the manufacture of bullet-proof vests sold by Second Chance Body Armor Inc., Point Blank Body Armor Inc. and Gator Hawk Armor Inc. These vests were purchased by the United States, and by various state, local, and/or tribal law enforcement agencies, which were partially reimbursed by a Justice Department program. The government alleged that the Zylon in these vests lost its ballistic capability quickly, especially when exposed to heat and humidity.</p>    <p>  Barrday was reportedly aware of the defective nature of the Zylon by at least December 2001, but continued to sell Zylon for use in ballistic armor until approximately 2003, when two police officers were shot through their Second Chance Zylon vests. In 2003, Barrday was the first weaver to permanently withdraw from the Zylon market.</p>    <p>  ""When a supplier of a component part distributes its product with knowledge of latent defects, that company violates the False Claims Act"" said Michael F. Hertz, the acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. ""This settlement will help ensure that component suppliers are held responsible for materials that put our first-responders at risk.""</p>    <p>  This settlement is part of a larger investigation of the body armor industry’s use of Zylon in body armor. As part of today’s agreement, Barrday has pledged its cooperation in the government’s on-going investigation. The United States previously has settled with four other participants in the Zylon body armor industry for over $46 million. Additionally, the government has pending lawsuits against Toyobo Co., Honeywell Inc., Second Chance Body Armor Inc. and four former Second Chance executives.</p>    <p>  Today’s settlement with Barrday was the result of an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department’s Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the General Services Administration Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Command, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Department of Energy Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of the Inspector General, and the Defense Contracting Audit Agency.</p>    <p>  </p>",1232686800,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-company-pay-us-more-1-million-related-sale-defective-bullet-proof-vests

78,79,Former Oak Ridge Complex Employee Pleads Guilty to Unlawful Disclosure of Restricted Atomic Energy Data,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, a resident of Harriman, Tenn., pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Knoxville, to count one of an indictment charging him with unlawful disclosure of Restricted Data under the Atomic Energy Act, in violation of 42 U.S.C., Section 2274(b).</p>    <p>  The guilty plea was announced today by Matthew G. Olsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and James R. Dedrick, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee.</p>    <p>  Oakley had been scheduled to start trial today, but appeared instead before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas A. Varlan, to enter his plea of guilty. Oakley had formerly been employed as a laborer and escort by Bechtel Jacobs at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) in Oak Ridge, Tenn. The ETTP, formerly known as K-25, had previously been operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as a facility to produce highly enriched uranium.</p>    <p>  According to the plea agreement, while employed at the ETTP in 2006 through 2007, Oakley had a security clearance that permitted him to have access to classified and protected materials, including instruments, appliances and information relating to the gaseous diffusion process for enriching uranium. Some of the materials and information to which Oakley had access were classified as ""Restricted Data"" under the Atomic Energy Act, any disclosure of which was illegal. While he worked at the ETTP, Oakley had been instructed and informed that this Restricted Data could not be disclosed.</p>    <p>  The plea agreement further states that based on the investigation the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that Oakley may have been in possession of protected materials that belonged to the DOE and was offering to sell the materials to a foreign government. The FBI initiated an undercover investigation and, in January 2007, the FBI contacted Oakley using an undercover agent assuming the role of an agent of a foreign government.</p>    <p>  In recorded calls and during a face-to-face meeting with the FBI undercover agent, Oakley stated that he had taken certain parts of uranium enrichment fuel rods or tubes and other associated hardware items from the ETTP work site and that he wanted to sell these materials for $200,000 to the foreign government. Once Oakley handed over the pieces of tubes and associated items to the undercover FBI agent and received $200,000 in cash, he was confronted by agents of the FBI and admitted to his efforts to sell these materials to a foreign government.</p>    <p>  The materials Oakley had tried to sell to a foreign government were, in fact, pieces of equipment known as ""barrier"" and associated hardware items that play a crucial role in the production of highly enriched uranium, a special nuclear material, through the gaseous diffusion process.</p>    <p>  The maximum penalty for violation of the Atomic Energy Act by disclosing Restricted Data is a maximum of ten years imprisonment and a criminal fine of $250,000. A sentencing hearing has been set before Judge Varlan for May 14, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., in U.S. District Court in Knoxville.</p>    <p>  Matthew G. Olsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said, ""Today’s guilty plea should serve as a strong warning to anyone who would consider selling restricted U.S. nuclear materials to foreign governments. The facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding America’s atomic energy data and pursuing aggressive prosecutions against those who attempt to breach those safeguards.""</p>    <p>  U.S. Attorney James R. Dedrick said, ""Vigorous enforcement of the law controlling the protection of national security information, especially that involving materials associated with atomic energy and weapons, is of the highest priority for the Department of Justice and is a vital part of our duty to protect national security and the nation’s defense system. The exposure of Oakley’s conduct and subsequent investigation by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Department of Justice reflects the Department’s dedication to combating any threat to the security of our nation’s atomic secrets wherever it may happen.""</p>    <p>  The indictment was the result of an investigation by the FBI, DOE’s Oak Ridge Counterintelligence Field Office, and DOE’s Headquarters Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.

80,81,Third Individual Pleads Guilty to Illegally Accessing Confidential Passport Files,"<p>  WASHINGTON – A third individual pleaded guilty today to illegally accessing numerous confidential passport application files, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division announced.</p>    <p>  Gerald R. Lueders, 65, of Woodbridge, Va., pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Kay in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to a one-count criminal information charging him with unauthorized computer access.</p>    <p>  According to court documents, from June 1974 through September 2001, Lueders served as a Foreign Service Officer at the State Department. From fall 2005 to February 2008, he worked as a watch officer within the Office of Consular Affairs. Lueders has also been a retired annuitant since October 2001, serving as a recruitment coordinator in various State Department bureaus. According to information contained in plea documents, Lueders admitted he had access to official State Department computer databases in the regular course of his employment, including the Passport Information Electronic Records System (PIERS), which contains, among other data, all imaged passport applications dating back to 1994. The imaged passport applications on PIERS contain, among other things, a photograph of the passport applicant as well as certain personal information including the applicant’s full name, date and place of birth, current address, telephone numbers, parent information, spouse’s name and emergency contact information. These confidential files are protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, and access by State Department employees is strictly limited to official government duties.</p>    <p>  In pleading guilty, Lueders admitted that between July 2005 and February 2008, he logged onto the PIERS database and viewed the passport applications of more than 50 celebrities, actors, politicians, musicians, athletes, family members, members of the media, business professionals, colleagues and other individuals identified in the press. Lueders admitted that he had no official government reason to access and view these passport applications, but that his sole purpose in accessing and viewing these passport applications was idle curiosity.</p>    <p>  Lueders is the third current or former State Department employee to plead guilty in this continuing investigation. On Sept. 22, 2008, Lawrence C. Yontz, a former Foreign Service Officer and intelligence analyst, pleaded guilty to unlawfully accessing hundreds of confidential passport files. Yontz was sentenced on Dec. 19, 2008, to 12 months of probation and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service. On Jan. 14, 2009, Dwayne F. Cross, a former administrative assistant and contract specialist, pleaded guilty to unlawfully accessing hundreds of confidential passport files. Cross’ sentencing is scheduled for March 23, 2009 and Lueders sentencing is scheduled for March 26, 2009.</p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Armando O. Bonilla of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section, headed by Section Chief William M.

81,82,"Former AIG Vice President Sentenced to Four Years in Prison 
for Role in Fraudulent Manipulation Scheme","  <p>  WASHINGTON – The former vice president of reinsurance of American International Group Inc. (AIG), was sentenced today to four years in prison for his role in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate AIG’s financial statements, the Department of Justice announced.</p>    <p>  Christian M. Milton, 61, of Wynnewood, Pa., who served as vice president of reinsurance at AIG from approximately 1982 to March 2005, was convicted by a federal jury on Feb. 25, 2008, on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, false statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mail fraud. In addition to the prison term, Milton was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Christopher F. Droney to two years of supervised release following his release from prison and a $200,000 fine. Milton was ordered to surrender himself to federal authorities in 60 days.</p>    <p>  Evidence presented at trial proved that Milton and his co-defendants, Ronald E. Ferguson, Elizabeth A. Monrad, Robert D. Graham and Christopher P. Garand, all former General Reinsurance Corporation (Gen Re) executive officers, engaged in a scheme to falsely inflate AIG’s reported loss reserves, a key indicator of financial health to insurance industry analysts and investors. According to trial evidence, the fraud was carried out through the use of two sham reinsurance transactions between subsidiaries of AIG and Gen Re in response to analysts’ criticism of a $59 million decrease in AIG’s loss reserves for the third quarter of 2000.</p>    <p>  The two sham transactions, evidence showed, increased AIG’s loss reserves by $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $250 million in the first quarter of 2001, masking a declining trend in loss reserves in the face of premium growth. Evidence showed that AIG restated the transactions at issue in filings with the SEC in May 2005. Evidence presented at trial established that when the investigation was disclosed to investors by AIG and through various media outlets between Feb. 14 and March 14, 2005, shares of AIG stock dropped from $73.12 to $61.92.</p>    <p>  All five defendants were convicted on all counts presented against them in the 16-count superseding indictment. Subsequently, on Oct. 31, 2008, Judge Droney found that AIG’s shareholders lost between $544 million and $597 million as a consequence of the defendants’ fraudulent scheme.</p>    <p>  According to evidence at trial, each of the defendants knew that the true purpose of the transactions was to permit AIG to falsely report increasing loss reserves in its statements to analysts, investors and in its SEC filings. The defendants structured a sham reinsurance transaction, according to trial evidence, and created a phony paper trail to make it appear as though Gen Re had solicited reinsurance from AIG when the evidence demonstrated that the parties knew AIG wanted the transaction to manipulate its financial statements. Additionally, evidence presented at trial proved that the defendants entered into a secret side deal whereby AIG would never have to pay any losses under the contracts; AIG would return to Gen Re the $10 million in premiums Gen Re paid to AIG and AIG paid Gen Re a $5 million fee for entering into the transaction.</p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Principal Deputy Chief Paul E. Pelletier and Assistant Chief Adam Safwat of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric J. Glover of the District of Connecticut and Ray Patricco of the Eastern District of Virginia. Additional assistance was provided by Paralegal Specialists Sarah Marberg of the Fraud Section, and Amy Konarski of the District of Connecticut.

82,83,"Three Men Indicted for Racially-Motivated Church Arson in Springfield, Mass.","<p>WASHINGTON – Three individuals were indicted today by a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts for conspiring to interfere with the civil rights of members of the Macedonia Church of God in Christ, a Springfield, Mass., church with a predominantly African-American congregation.</p>

<p>The indictment was announced by Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division; U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan for the District of Massachusetts; Glenn N. Anderson, Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - Boston Field Division; Warren T. Bamford, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Boston Field Office; Colonel Mark Delaney, Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police; William Bennett, Hampden County District Attorney; and Commissioner William J. Fitchet of the Springfield Police Department.</p>

<p>The church’s newly constructed building burned to the ground on Nov. 5, 2008, hours after the election of President Barack Obama. The indictment alleges that Benjamin Haskell, 22, Michael Jacques, 24, and Thomas Gleason, 21, all of Springfield, conspired to burn the church in retaliation for the election of the country’s first African-American president.</p>

<p>""These allegations of racial violence connected with the presidential election are serious and disturbing,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King. ""The Justice Department will aggressively prosecute individuals who conspire to commit such acts of violence and intimidation.""</p>

<p>The indictment alleges that several hours after Barack Obama was elected President, Haskell, Jacques and Gleason conspired to burn the Macedonia Church of God in Christ’s new under-construction church building, which was 75 percent complete at the time of the fire. According to the indictment, on Election Night, Haskell, Jacques and Gleason used racial slurs and expressed anger with the election of Barack Obama and discussed burning the Macedonia Church of God in Christ’s new church building because the church members, congregants and bishop were African-American. They then obtained gasoline, poured it on the interior and exterior of the new church building and started a fire that destroyed nearly the entire structure. Some of the responding firefighters suffered injuries as they worked to extinguish the blaze.</p>

<p>""Racism has devastating effects on individuals, and stifles the quality of life in the community,"" said U.S. Attorney Sullivan.  ""We will not tolerate those who victimize others and I am angered and saddened that the neighborhood has endured such cruel acts by those allegedly living in the same community.""  </p>

<p>If convicted, Haskell, Jacques and Gleason face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years to be followed by three years of supervised release. The details contained in the indictment are allegations. The defendants are presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>

<p>The case is being investigated by the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Massachusetts State Police; Hampden County District Attorney’s Office and the Springfield Police Department. It is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Erin Aslan of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul Smyth and Kevin O’Regan of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts.</p>

83,84,Owner of Pharmaceutical Wholesale Company Pleads Guilty to Medicare Fraud,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – The owner and operator of HME Solutions Inc., dba Lifecare Medical (Lifecare Medical), a licensed pharmaceutical wholesale company in Miami, pleaded guilty today to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV-infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced.</p>    <p>  Harold Sio, 33, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in Miami. At the plea hearing, Sio admitted that between August 2004 and November 2006, he conspired with Juan A. Marrero and Orlando Pascual Jr., the owners of Medcore Group LLC (Medcore), to commit health care fraud and launder the proceeds of that health care fraud.</p>    <p>  In his plea, Sio admitted that he supplied pharmaceuticals to Marrero and Pascual for the purpose of committing Medicare fraud. Sio also admitted providing invoices that documented huge quantities of pharmaceuticals, which were received by Medcore, when in fact he only delivered small amounts. Sio acknowledged that he accepted payment from Marrero and Pascual then returned cash to them so that the cash could ultimately be used to pay patients. Marrero and Pascual pleaded guilty in January 2009 to Medicare fraud and are scheduled for sentencing on April 3, 2009. Sio is scheduled to be sentenced on March 24, 2009.</p>    <p>  In pleading guilty, Marrero and Pascual both admitted that they falsely billed Medicare more than $5.3 million for unnecessary infusion treatments. Both Marrero and Pascual acknowledged that all the patients who received injections or infusions at Medcore were paid cash kickbacks to induce them to visit to the clinic.</p>    <p>  Marrero and Pascual acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples to make the patients’ need for treatment appear legitimate, when in fact it was not, as well as to make the patients' medical files appear legitimate. According to court documents, physicians, a physician's assistant and phlebotomists, were used by Marrero and Pascual to help facilitate the scheme.</p>    <p>  Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 23, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment is merely a charge, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S.

84,85,"Justice Department Settles Allegations of Disability and Religious Discrimination Against Nashville, Tenn.","  <p>  WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced a settlement resolving allegations that the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metropolitan Government) violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) by discriminating against Teen Challenge, a Christian substance abuse treatment program.</p>    <p>  In a federal lawsuit filed in September 2008, the U.S. government alleged that the Metropolitan Government discriminated against individuals with disabilities in violation of the FHA and imposed a substantial burden on religious exercise in violation of RLUIPA. According to the complaint filed by the U.S. government, the Metropolitan Government denied Teen Challenge a building permit to operate in Goodlettsville, Tenn., and amended its zoning code in a manner that prevented Teen Challenge from using the property. The settlement resolves the U.S. government’s claims as well as a related lawsuit filed by Teen Challenge and participants in Teen Challenge’s program.</p>    <p>  ""Cases like this show how the FHA and RLUIPA work together to ensure that persons with disabilities are not discriminated against and that religious groups seeking to aid those persons can operate without unjustifiable burdens,"" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.</p>    <p>  ""Discrimination of the type alleged in this case should never be tolerated by a free society,"" said U. S. Attorney Ed Yarbrough following the settlement. ""Substance abuse programs perform a valuable service to persons suffering from addiction."" he added.</p>    <p>  The settlement, which must still be approved by the court, requires the Metropolitan Government to train nearly 100 employees and officials who make zoning and land use decisions on the requirements of the FHA and RLUIPA, to appoint a compliance officer to receive complaints and ensure compliance with the settlement, and to provide periodic reports to the Justice Department. As part of the settlement, the Metropolitan Government rescinded the amendment to its zoning code that affected Teen Challenge and adopted a reasonable accommodation policy for individuals with disabilities.</p>    <p>  The Metropolitan Government will also pay a $20,000 civil penalty to the United States and $50,000 to participants in Teen Challenge’s program. Monetary relief to Teen Challenge is being determined by the final court order in the related case of Teen Challenge International, Nashville Headquarters, et al. v.

85,86,"Former NFL Player, Ex-Casino Owner and Nevada Businessman Indicted in Massive Tax Fraud Scheme","  <p>  WASHINGTON - A Las Vegas federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging Alan Rodrigues, a former pit boss and casino owner from Henderson, Nev.; Weston Coolidge, a businessman from Las Vegas; and Joseph Prokop, a former National Football League punter from Upland, Calif., with a tax fraud scheme for their promotion of a fraudulent tax product through the now defunct National Audit Defense Network (NADN), the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced today.</p>    <p>  The defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, 15 counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns, and five counts of mail fraud for their part in the scheme. According to the indictment, Rodrigues was NADN’s general manager, Coolidge was NADN’s chairman and president and Prokop was the national marketing director of Oryan Management and Financial Services. It is alleged that Oryan Management and Financial Services is a sole proprietorship, operating in Upland, Calif., that paid NADN a commission to sell Tax Break 2000.</p>    <p>  According to the indictment, in early 2001, NADN began selling Tax Break 2000, a shopping Web site that the defendants fraudulently stated would allow customers to claim legitimate income tax credits and deductions under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Internal Revenue Code. NADN allegedly marketed its services nationwide through radio advertisements and promotional appearances on talk radio programs. The indictment further alleges that, from 2001 through 2004, the defendants caused NADN to sell Tax Break 2000 approximately 21,610 times to customers around the country. Throughout the scheme, Tax Break 2000 was also known as tb2000.com, shopn2000.com and mallforall.com.</p>    <p>  According to the indictment, Tax Break 2000 was an attempt to abuse a provision of the ADA that provides a ""disabled access credit"" to help offset necessary, reasonable expenditures made by eligible small businesses to comply with the ADA’s requirement that their facilities be accessible to disabled persons. The indictment alleges that these expenditures include amounts paid to remove architectural barriers, to remove communication barriers, to provide interpreters, to acquire or to modify equipment, or to provide other similar services, modifications, materials or equipment.</p>    <p>  The indictment further alleges that the defendants defrauded the United States and their customers in a number of ways. Some of the ways alleged in the indictment included creating Tax Break 2000 as a Web site that was not accessible to the disabled so that they could sell modifications that purported to make it accessible to the disabled; falsely telling customers that purchasing the modifications entitled them to a lawful income tax credit and deduction for having made their Web sites accessible to the disabled; and choosing the sale price for the modifications, $10,475.00, solely to maximize the fraudulent income tax credits and deductions.</p>    <p>  Additionally, the indictment alleges the defendants induced customers to sign supposed promissory notes for approximately 80% of the $10,475.00 purchase price of the modifications, when they had no expectation that the customers would make payments on the promissory notes; paying attorneys to write favorable opinion letters about Tax Break 2000 to refute a legal memorandum in which NADN’s own tax experts determined that Tax Break 2000 was illegal and could subject those who sold it to criminal penalties; creating false IRS Forms 1099 to create the appearance that customers’ Web sites were generating commission income and that the purported promissory notes were being paid off; and preparing false tax returns on their customers’ behalf.</p>    <p>  On April 13, 2004, the Justice Department’s Tax Division <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/prtax/txdv04233.htm"">  <span style=""text-decoration:underline"">    <span style=""color:#0000ff"">  filed a complaint</span></span></a> seeking to enjoin, among others, NADN, Rodrigues, Coolidge and Prokop from selling fraudulent tax schemes, including Tax Break 2000.

as Russian Agents and Money Laundering","  <p>  WASHINGTON -- A federal indictment was unsealed today in U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon charging Harold James Nicholson, 58, of Sheridan, Ore., and Nathaniel James Nicholson, 24, of Eugene, Ore., with two counts of Conspiracy, one count of Acting as Agents of a Foreign Government, and four counts of Money Laundering.</p>    <p>  Both defendants are scheduled to appear today at 1:30 p.m. before U.S. Magistrate Janice M. Stewart for arraignment on the indictment. The maximum penalty for the substantive charge of acting as an agent of a foreign government is ten years imprisonment, while the maximum penalty for conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government is five years imprisonment. Each money laundering count, including the money laundering conspiracy, carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. The indictment also seeks forfeiture of funds provided to Nathaniel J. Nicholson by the Russian Federation, which the indictment alleges are the proceeds of his father’s past espionage activities.</p>    <p>  As set forth in the indictment, Harold J. Nicholson, a former CIA employee, is serving a 283-month (more than 23-year) sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan, Ore., for a 1997 conviction of conspiracy to commit espionage. The indictment further alleges that defendant Harold J. Nicholson, working through his son Nathaniel J. Nicholson, received cash proceeds of his past espionage activities from, and passed information to, agents of the Russian Federation between 2006 and 2008.</p>    <p>  As described in the indictment, during the course of the conspiracy, Nathaniel J. Nicholson met with his father Harold J. Nicholson on several occasions to obtain information that was intended to be provided to the Russian Federation. Defendant Nathaniel J. Nicholson then travelled to various places to meet with representatives of the Russian Federation, including San Francisco, Calif.; Mexico City, Mexico; Lima, Peru; and Cyprus, where he collected money from them and received additional instructions. Defendant Nathaniel J. Nicholson then brought the funds he received back to Oregon to disperse to family members at the direction of his imprisoned father.</p>    <p>  The indictment further alleges that the funds paid by the Russian Federation to defendant Nathaniel J. Nicholson represented proceeds of his father’s past espionage activities.

Immergut stated, ""The conduct alleged in the indictment shows a sinister and continuing scheme by a former senior CIA officer turned spy to betray the United States of America for financial gain.

Olsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said, ""Today’s indictment alleges that an imprisoned spy recruited and trained his own 24-year-old son to travel the globe to collect on past spying debts and channel information to foreign agents. These charges underscore the continuing threat posed by foreign intelligence services and should send a clear message to others who would consider selling out their country for money.""</p>    <p>  ""Harold James Nicholson, already convicted of spying and compromising national security, thought he could profit from his previous espionage despite being behind bars,"" said Executive Assistant Director Arthur M. Cummings, II, of the FBI National Security Division. ""Now, along with his son, he again acted against the interests of the United States, according to the charges.""</p>    <p>  ""This is an amazing case,"" said David Ian Miller, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Oregon. ""Harold James Nicholson, a convicted spy, was allowed to serve time in a federal prison in Oregon to be near his family.  Without regret, he used that proximity to his family to continue contact with the foreign country for which he was previously convicted of spying.""</p>    <p>  The FBI and the Federal Bureau of Prisons investigated this case. Assistant U. S. Attorneys Pamala Holsinger and Ethan Knight are prosecuting this case. Trial Attorney Patrick Murphy of the Counterespionage Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division is also assisting.</p>    <p>  An indictment is only an accusation of a crime, and a defendant should be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>",1233205200,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/imprisoned-spy-and-his-son-indicted-charges-acting-russian-agents-and-money-laundering
89,90,"Former Shipping Executive Sentenced to 48 Months in Jail
for His Role in Antitrust Conspiracy","  <p>  WASHINGTON   — A former high-level shipping executive was sentenced today to serve 48 months in jail and to pay a $20,000 criminal fine for his role in an antitrust conspiracy involving the transportation of goods to and from the continental United States and Puerto Rico by ocean vessel, the Department of Justice announced today. This is the longest jail sentence ever imposed for a single antitrust charge.</p>    <p>  Peter Baci of Jacksonville, Fla., pleaded guilty on Oct. 20, 2008, in the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville for his role in the conspiracy, which began at least as early as May 2002 and continued until as late as April 2008. Baci was charged with engaging in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition in the coastal water freight transportation services between the continental United States and Puerto Rico by agreeing to allocate customers, agreeing to rig bids submitted to government and commercial buyers, and agreeing to fix the prices of rates, surcharges, and other fees charged to customers.</p>    <p>  Related antitrust charges remain pending in the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville against three other shipping executives: R. Kevin Gill and Gregory Glova, of Charlotte, N.C. and Gabriel Serra, of San Juan, Puerto Rico. A related obstruction of justice charge is also pending against a fifth shipping executive, Alexander Chisholm, of Jacksonville.</p>    <p>  ""Today’s sentencing should make clear that individuals who violate the antitrust laws will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Scott D. Hammond, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division. ""Significant jail time will be a consequence of harming consumers and competition in both the continental United States and Puerto Rico.""</p>    <p>  Baci worked for a large U.S. company that provides freight shipping services to customers transporting goods between the continental United States and Puerto Rico. These companies transport a variety of cargo shipments, such as heavy equipment, medicine, food and consumer goods. Sales of freight services in the United States to Puerto Rico shipping lane total hundreds of millions of dollars every year, as ocean shipping is a primary way for people in Puerto Rico to receive essential goods.</p>    <p>  In June 2004, Congress raised the maximum sentence for antitrust crimes from three years imprisonment to 10 years imprisonment. While longer jail sentences have been imposed against individuals who violated the antitrust laws together with other crimes, this case represents the first time that an individual was sentenced to more than three years for a single antitrust charge.</p>    <p>  The current prosecution and pending charges arose from an ongoing federal antitrust investigation into bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the shipping industry, which is being conducted by the National Criminal Enforcement Section of the Antitrust Division and the Jacksonville Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Anyone with information concerning the focus of this investigation is urged to call the Antitrust Division’s National Criminal Enforcement Section at 202-307-6694, or the FBI’s Jacksonville Field Office at 904-721-1211.</p>",1233291600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-shipping-executive-sentenced-48-months-jail-his-role-antitrust-conspiracy
90,91,Justice Department Settles Lawsuit Alleging Gender Discrimination and Retaliation by the Puerto Rico Police Department,"  <p>  WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice today announced that it has reached a consent decree with the Policía de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Police Department or PRPD) that will, if approved by the federal district court, resolve a complaint the Department filed in March 2008 alleging that the PRPD engaged in unlawful employment discrimination based on gender and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin and religion, and also prohibits retaliation against persons for filing charges of discrimination.</p>    <p>  The U.S. government alleged in its March 2008 complaint that the PRPD discriminated against Officer Jeannette Caraballo Lopez (Caraballo) on the basis of her sex by, among other ways, requiring her to perform secretarial tasks not required of male officers and by subjecting her to sexually discriminatory comments. For example, while working as an agent-investigator in the Division of Investigation of Stolen Vehicles for the Fajardo Area, she was told that the Division was, ""not for females,"" or words to that effect, in violation of Title VII. The complaint also alleged that the PRPD retaliated against Officer Caraballo because she opposed employment practices that she reasonably believed to be unlawful, and because she filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII. The complaint further alleged that the PRPD retaliated against Officer Manuel Bonilla Carrasquillo (Bonilla) because he opposed employment practices that he reasonably believed to be unlawful.</p>    <p>  Under the terms of the consent decree, the PRPD will offer monetary awards totaling $125,000, including attorney’s fees, to the two officers. Officer Caraballo also will be offered reinstatement to an agent-investigator position with remedial seniority and related benefits and compensation. Officer Bonilla, who retired in September 2007, will be offered all the benefits and compensation to which he would have been entitled had he remained in his previous position without interruption until his retirement. The PRPD will also provide training on equal employment opportunity law, including discrimination based on gender and retaliation, to all supervisors in the Fajardo Area.</p>    <p>  ""We are pleased that the PRPD has agreed to resolve this case by entering into an appropriate consent decree,"" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. ""The law does not allow employers to discriminate against women by only allowing them to perform duties that have been traditionally deemed ‘female’ assignments, or to retaliate against employees because they participate in an employment discrimination investigation.""</p>    <p>  The enforcement of Title VII continues to be a priority of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

91,92,Former Lobbyist Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Commit Honest Services Fraud,"  <p>  WASHINGTON – A former lobbyist pleaded guilty today to conspiring with others to commit honest services fraud, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division announced.</p>    <p>  Todd A. Boulanger, 37, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Richard W. Roberts in the District of Columbia. According to court documents, Boulanger worked as a lobbyist from 1999 through 2004 with Jack Abramoff and others. Boulanger, Abramoff, and other lobbyists working with them, sought to advance the interests of groups and companies they represented by lobbying federal legislative and executive branch officials. According to court documents, Boulanger admitted that he, Abramoff and others established contacts with federal legislative and executive branch officials who could use their influence and positions to take official actions favorable to Boulanger and the other lobbyists. After establishing contacts with certain public officials, Boulanger admitted that he, Abramoff, and others offered and gave numerous things of value to these public officials in an effort to reward them for actions they had taken, to influence the public officials in their official actions, and to make them more receptive to requests for official actions in the future.</p>    <p>  Boulanger admitted that the things of value he and others provided as part of this conspiracy included all-expenses-paid travel, tens of thousands of dollars-worth of tickets to professional sporting events, concerts and other events, and frequent and expensive meals and drinks at Washington, D.C.-area restaurants and bars. According to court documents, the public officials, in turn, agreed to take and took favorable official actions, which included the insertion or protection of legislative appropriations; the insertion, protection, removal or prevention of legislative amendments; and lobbying by the public officials of other legislative and executive branch officials to take or abstain from taking official action. According to court documents, Boulanger admitted that he, Abramoff and others attempted to conceal their practice of providing things of value to public officials.</p>    <p>  Specifically, according to the plea agreement, Boulanger sought the assistance of a staff member who worked on the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. One of Boulanger’s clients was an equipment rental company, on whose behalf Boulanger and another lobbyist, James Hirni, sought to have two legislative amendments inserted into the Federal Highway Bill in 2003. Boulanger admitted that, with his knowledge and approval, Hirni and another individual provided an all-expenses-paid trip on Oct. 18 and 19, 2003, to game one of the Baseball World Series in New York City to the committee staff member and to Trevor Blackann, a former staff member to a U.S. Senator. On Oct. 22, 2003, Boulanger and Hirni provided information about the amendments they were seeking to the committee staff member and Blackann. Later, after one of the amendments had been inserted into the Senate version of the Federal Highway Bill, Boulanger, Hirni, Blackann, the committee staff member and another individual took steps to protect that amendment   </p>    <p>  Boulanger also admitted that he and others provided a stream of things of value to a different Senate staff member in order to influence that individual to take official action favorable to Boulanger’s lobbying firm and one of Abramoff’s Native American tribal clients. From March 2002 through March 2004, Boulanger and others provided more than $25,000 worth of tickets, meals and drinks to the Senate staff member. During the same time period, the Senate staff member provided and agreed to provide official actions sought by Boulanger and others on repeated occasions. In addition, Boulanger admitted that he provided more than $10,000 worth of tickets, meals and drinks to the legislative director for a U.S. Senator. Boulanger admitted he met the legislative director on July 16, 2002, and provided the things of value for 20 months following their first meeting.</p>    <p>  The case is part of the ongoing investigation into the activities of former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates. Abramoff pleaded guilty in January 2006 to conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, honest services fraud and tax evasion.  Abramoff was sentenced in September 2008 to 48 months in prison and is cooperating in the investigation. Both Hirni and Blackann have pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme and are cooperating with the investigation. In all, seventeen individuals, including lobbyists and public officials, have pleaded guilty, been convicted at trial, or are awaiting trial as a result of the investigation.</p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by trial attorneys M. Kendall Day and Peter C. Sprung of the Public Integrity Section, headed by Section Chief William M. Welch II. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI.</p>",1233291600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-lobbyist-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-commit-honest-services-fraud
92,93,Eight Charged with Illegally Harvesting and Selling Striped Bass,"  <p>  WASHINGTON— Five commercial fishermen in St. Mary’s County, Md., a fish wholesaler, its owner and an employee have been charged in Maryland and Washington, D.C., for their role in the illegal harvest, sale, and purchase of hundreds of thousands of pounds of striped bass from the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River from 2003 through 2007, the Justice Department announced today. </p>    <p>   According to the criminal informations, the individuals and corporation have been charged with violating the Lacey Act, which is a federal law that prohibits individuals or corporations from creating false records for fish or wildlife, and from transporting, selling, or buying fish and wildlife harvested illegally.  Specifically, the informations allege that the commercial fishermen transported and sold striped bass, knowing that they had falsely recorded on their permit allocation cards the numbers and weight of the striped bass they caught and failed to accurately record the times when the fish were actually harvested.</p>    <p>   Individuals charged include:</p>  <blockquote>  <ul><li>Thomas L. Crowder Jr. of Leonardtown, Md.</li>  <li>John W. Dean of Scotland, Md.</li>  <li>Charles Quade of Churchtown, Md.</li>  <li>Thomas L. Hallock of Catharpin, Va.</li>  <li>Keith A. Collins of Deale, Md.</li>  <li>Robert Moore Sr. of Falls Church, Va.</li>  <li>Robert Moore Jr. of Ashburn, Va.</li>  </ul></blockquote>    <p>   The company charged is Cannon Seafood Inc., located in Washington, D.C., with Robert Moore Sr., as its owner.</p>    <p>   Two additional St. Mary’s County commercial fishermen were indicted in October 2008 for similar conduct.  Joseph Peter Nelson and Joseph Peter Nelson, Jr., are charged in the District of Maryland in a seven count felony indictment, alleging one count of felony conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act, and six substantive felony Lacey Act counts.  The indictment also seeks forfeiture of vessels and vehicles allegedly used by the Nelsons in carrying out the offenses.  The indictment alleges that from September 2003 through March 2007 the defendants exceeded their quota of Maryland striped bass by failing to check in all the fish they caught and by falsely inflating the numbers of fish that they allegedly checked-in in order to secure additional Maryland tags.  It also alleges that the defendants placed Maryland tags on fish that were not caught in that state’s regulated waters, and placed tags on fish that falsely indicated that they were caught by hook and line when they were not.  The indictment further alleges that the Nelsons engaged in a series of sales of unlawfully caught fish to undercover agents who were posing as out of state fish wholesalers.  </p>    <p>   In early spring each year, wild coastal striped bass (Morone saxatilis), known regionally as rockfish, enter the estuary or river where they were born to spawn, and then return to ocean waters to live, migrating along the coastline.  Fish spawned from the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem contribute the greatest number of striped bass to the Atlantic coastal fishery, and the commercial fishery for Atlantic coastal striped bass is based primarily on migrations of fish born in the Chesapeake Bay area. Striped bass do not die after spawning.  They may live up to 30 years and reach 50 pounds or more.  The population of coastal Atlantic striped bass depends heavily upon the capability of older, larger, female striped bass to successfully reproduce. </p>    <p>   Maryland regulates the commercial catch of striped bass from its waters and enforces the regulations of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission, which regulates the commercial catch of striped bass from Maryland waters located in the main stem of the Potomac River.  The striped bass management and protection measures, including tagging requirements, closed seasons, size limits, and quota amounts, are focused on maintaining a target spawning stock to protect the fishery from over-fishing.  Maryland also requires that all fish caught by a commercial fisherman be weighed and counted at a designated state check-in station, with the total number and total weight of the fish caught recorded on the commercial fisherman’s permit allocation card and transmitted to the state of Maryland on a check station daily catch reporting sheet. </p>    <p>   A criminal information and indictment are not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by criminal information or indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law. </p>    <p>   The Lacey Act carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000, plus the potential forfeiture of the vessels and vehicles used in committing the offense.</p>    <p>   The charges are a result of the investigation by an interstate task force formed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Natural Resources Police and the Virginia Marine Police, Special Investigative Unit in 2003.  The task force conducted undercover purchases and sales of striped bass in 2003, engaged in covert observation of commercial fishing operations in the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River area, and conducted detailed analysis of area striped bass catch reporting and commercial business sales records from 2003 through 2007.  The investigation is continuing, and charges against others are possible.</p>    <p>   These cases are being prosecuted by Senior Trial Attorney Wayne Hettenbach of the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacy Belf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland with assistance from the U.S. Attorneys’ Office for the District of Columbia.</p>",1233291600,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/eight-charged-illegally-harvesting-and-selling-striped-bass

95,96,Final Defendant Pleads Guilty to Anti-Obama Assaults,"<p>WASHINGTON - Ralph Nicoletti pleaded guilty in Brooklyn, N.Y., federal court today before U.S. District Judge Carol B. Amon to committing three assaults targeting African-American residents in Staten Island, N.Y., on the night of President Barack Obama’s election victory. Nicoletti was the last of four defendants to plead guilty in the federal prosecution stemming from the attacks. The other three defendants – Bryan Garaventa, Michael Contreras and Brian Carranza – previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit the hate crime assaults and each face sentences of up to 10 years in prison. As part of his plea, Nicoletti has agreed to a sentence of 12 years, subject to the court’s approval.</p>

<p>The guilty plea was announced by Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division; Benton J. Campbell, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Joseph M. Demarest, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, FBI, New York Field Office; and Raymond W. Kelly, Commissioner, New York City Police Department.</p>

<p>At the plea proceeding, Nicoletti admitted that on Nov. 4, 2008, the night of the presidential election, the defendants decided to assault African-Americans in Staten Island after President Obama was declared the winner of the election. The defendants targeted African-Americans believing that they had voted for President Obama. Nicoletti drove the group to the Park Hill section of Staten Island, a predominantly African-American neighborhood, where they came upon an African-American teenager and assaulted him. Nicoletti struck the teenager with a metal pipe and Garaventa hit him with a collapsible police baton.</p>

<p>Nicoletti then drove to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, where the defendants assaulted an unidentified African-American man. During that assault, Garaventa tripped the victim and pushed him to the ground.</p>

<p>The third assault was against an individual whom the defendants mistakenly believed was African-American. The plan was for Contreras to hit the victim with the police baton as the defendants drove by him. Instead, Nicoletti deliberately drove his car into the victim’s body. The victim was thrown onto the hood of the car and hit the front windshield, smashing it. The victim was seriously injured and remained in a coma for several weeks after the attack.</p>

<p>""This successful prosecution sends a clear message that racially-motivated acts of violence targeted at those who are exercising their right to vote are intolerable and will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General King. ""It is a tragedy that these crimes occur at all, but the Department of Justice will remain vigilant in our efforts to combat hate crimes, as they tear at the very fabric of our great nation.""</p>

<p>""The conduct of the defendants is shocking and deplorable,"" stated U.S. Attorney Campbell. ""On a night of historic significance, these four angry men assaulted their victims in an attempt to punish them for exercising a fundamental right of all Americans – the right to vote. Those who commit such crimes will be swiftly apprehended, prosecuted and punished. We are grateful for our partnership with the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the FBI and the New York City Police Department, which has been vital to the success of this case, and I particularly wish to thank the Richmond County District Attorney’s Office for its assistance in this matter.""</p>

<p>""The crimes these defendants have now admitted to were violent assaults that in one case nearly killed a man,"" said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Demarest of the New York Field Office.  ""In attempting to intimidate voters, the defendants also violated the victims’ civil rights in a way that was an attack on the democratic process.  These were serious crimes that prompted the serious response the FBI will always bring to bear in civil rights enforcement.""</p>

<p>""It was important to make certain that those who seriously injured individuals, based on their race, did not escape justice,"" said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. ""NYPD Inspector Michael J. Osgood, Commanding Officer of the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force, had the foresight to assign a special team on Election Night until 4 a.m. the next morning. As a result, his investigators were in position to respond quickly to the bias attacks as reports of them began to emerge.  Detectives located an eyewitness to one of the attacks, and their subsequent distribution of flyers in the Rosebank area of Staten Island over three days led to the first major break in the case.  I also want to thank the FBI agents who helped, and the federal prosecutors who succeeded in winning the guilty pleas.""</p>

<p>The government’s case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pamela K. Chen and Margo K. Brodie, and Department of Justice Special Litigation Counsel Kristy Parker.</p>

98,99,"U.S. Recovers $19 Million from AMEC Construction Management
to Settle Litigation Regarding Fraud, False Claims, Kickbacks
& Re-Procurement Costs on Federal Construction Contracts","  <p>  WASHINGTON   – The United States has recovered more than $19 million from AMEC Construction Management Inc. (ACMI) to resolve allegations of fraud, false claims and kickbacks on four General Services Administration (GSA) construction contracts, as well as litigation over claims by the GSA for excess re-procurement costs incurred by GSA after it terminated ACMI’s contract to build the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse in St. Louis, Missouri, the Department of Justice announced today. ACMI was formerly known as Morse Diesel International Inc.</p>    <p>  In counterclaims filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the United States sought damages and penalties under the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Act and common law theories for false bond reimbursement claims submitted by ACMI to the GSA and bond premium kickbacks paid by the company’s bond broker to ACMI’s United Kingdom parent company, AMEC plc, on four federal contracts: two for the construction of the Eagleton Courthouse; a third for the construction of the U.S. courthouse and federal building in Sacramento, Calif.; and a fourth for renovations to the U.S. customs house in San Francisco. The government also sought a declaration from the court that ACMI’s claims against the government were forfeited on account of its fraud, as provided by the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act.</p>    <p>  In July 2005 and January 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment against ACMI and held the company liable to the United States for its violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and the False Claims Act. The court also held that ACMI had forfeited its right to pursue its own claims against the government. In October 2007, the federal claims court awarded the government damages and penalties totaling nearly $7.3 million. The government obtained a writ of garnishment for the damages and penalties owed it in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and ACMI has agreed to have a total of more than $8 million paid to the government as part of the settlement.</p>    <p>  The settlement also will resolve litigation in the Court of Federal Claims regarding the excess re-procurement costs incurred by the GSA when it undertook the completion of the Eagleton Courthouse after terminating ACMI for default in 1999. ACMI has agreed to settle those claims for a total of more than $11 million, including amounts that the GSA retained as set-offs from other matters involving ACMI.</p>    <p>  ""Federal contractors who commit fraud against the government will be pursued aggressively and will be held accountable for their violations of law,"" said Michael F. Hertz, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice's Civil Division. ""This settlement is an example of the Department’s determination to ensure that federal funds are protected from fraud and abuse.""</p>    <p>  The case was filed after an audit and investigation by the GSA’s Office of the Inspector General revealed the bond fraud. The kickbacks were uncovered during the litigation. ACMI also entered guilty pleas to felony fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in December 2000 and in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in March 2002 for the bond frauds involved in today’s civil settlement.</p>",1233550800,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-recovers-19-million-amec-construction-management-settle-litigation-regarding-fraud-false
